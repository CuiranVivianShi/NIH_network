ALS is an inexorably progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no effective therapy.  Familial ALS due to specific mutations in the SOD1 gene (e.g. A4V) is a very rapidly progressive form of the disease that is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of SOD1-containing aggregates within both neurons and astrocytes.  Mutant SOD1 reduces the activity of heat shock proteins and thereby permits the formation of protein aggregates that constitute these neuronal and astrocytic inclusions.  Arimoclomol a co-inducer of heat shock protein gene expression promotes de novo protein folding facilitates repair of misfolded proteins and targets misfolded proteins for degradation.  In addition to its targeting a pathogenic mechanism in SOD1 positive familial ALS arimoclomol significantly prolongs survival in the SOD1 mouse model of ALS even when administered after the appearance of clinically manifest disease.  Furthermore arimoclomol has proven safe and tolerable in a Phase 2a study of patients with sporadic ALS it crosses the blood-brain barrier and exhibits a dose-dependent increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration.  This seamless adaptive Phase 2/3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial will enroll approximately 80 participants in two stages.  The first stage will include 30 participants followed monthly over a period of 6 months.  Results of this first stage will be used to determine safety tolerability futility and potential efficacy of arimoclomol.  The analysis of this stage-1 data will also be used to re-estimate the sample size required for the second stage of the study that will include approximately an additional 50 subjects followed over a period of 12 months.  Participants in stage-1 will continue to be followed for an additional 6 months in stage-2.  The primary outcome measure is the change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) between baseline and the month-12 visit.  Secondary outcome measures include time to tracheostomy or permanent assisted ventilation forced vital capacity negative inspiratory force strength long-term safety and tolerability of arimoclomol as well as motor unit number estimates.      ","52608",

We showed that mice with reduced (15% of normal) CBF2 levels generate all blood cell lineages with the exception of T and NK cells. T cell development in CBF2-insufficient mice aborts at the specification stage as the very earliest markers of T cell differentiation fail to be expressed. NK cell development also fails very early at the transition between NK progenitors and immature NK cells. We propose to further characterize the NK cell defect caused by CBF2 insufficiency by determining which DNA-binding Runx subunit (or subunits) are required for the progression of NK progenitors to immature NK cells. We will also use in vitro assays of T and NK cell development to probe the CBF's biochemical functions in these lineages. Specifically we will identify and characterize chromatin-remodeling proteins recruited by the CBFs to their target genes in T and NK cells and assess the relevance of these proteins for T and NK cell development. We will assess chromatin occupancy by the CBF-interacting proteins to determine whether they associate with all or a subset of genes bound by the CBFs and if their occupancy correlates with active or inactive chromatin states.    Project Narrative: These studies aim to understand how proteins that are essential for lymphocyte formation perform their functions.

A strong relationship exists between sand flies and Leishmania such that in nature only certain species of sand flies are able to transmit certain species of Leishmania. Such species-specificity is driven by several molecular factors that allow the parasite to infect survive and multiply within the midgut of the sand fly and be transmitted to a suitable host during a blood meal. Some sand fly species are considered permissive in that they are able to harbor experimental infections of several Leishmania species (e.g. Lutzomyia. longipalpis); other sand fly species are considered restrictive as they can only be infected with the Leishmania species that they carry in nature (e.g. Phlebotomus. papatasi). The precise interactions that lead to this vector competence whether for permissive or restrictive vectors remain to be completely elucidated. We previously defined one specific interaction between L. major lipophosphoglycan and a P. papatasi galectin-like molecule that is essential for vector competence and demonstrated that antibodies targeted to this midgut molecule prevent establishment of Leishmania major within the sand fly midgut. Here we propose a set of studies using this restrictive vector/parasite system to identify additional sand fly molecules that participate in the development of Leishmania within the sand fly midgut. Our studies will specifically focus on the use of RNA interference to assess the roles of proteins such as PpChym2 a blood-induced chymotrypsin that may be involved in early killing of Leishmania; and PpChit1 a midgut-specific chitinase that is thought to play a role in Leishmania escape from the peritrophic matrix. Additionally recently identified midgut transcripts such as those coding for peritrophins and thrombin-specific inhibitors will also be evaluated. Once identified P. papatasi molecules that effectively interfere with the development of L. major also will be tested for their broad spectrum activity in other sand fly vector combinations including P. argentipes and L. donovani. This research will advance the knowledge regarding sand fly-Leishmania interaction and will provide insights for the selection of transmission blocking candidates as a strategy to eliminate and/or reduce leishmaniasis. Project Narrative: Phlebotomine sand flies are the main vectors of leishmaniasis a multi-spectrum disease that causes substantial morbidity and mortality in the developing world. As effective therapies are un-affordable to most patients and no vaccines are available vector-based strategies specifically transmission-blocking vaccines are becoming a choice strategy to control many vector transmitted diseases. Our studies aim at assessing the effect of silencing a selected number of sand fly proteins thought to be involved in Leishmania development within the sand fly; elucidating how these proteins interact with Leishmania parasites undoubtedly will lead to the development of novel strategies to fight parasite transmission.         ","246766",

The ultimate promise of this research is the discovery of genes that predispose to brain disorders and mental illnesses. Our focus is on the genetic analysis of variation in brain structure and function in randomly sampled extended pedigrees to provide significant clues regarding the specific genes that are involved in both normal and pathological brain function. In 2006 we began collecting brain-related endophenotypes on related Mexican American individuals for linkage-based analyses (MH078111 & MH078143). However given the number of recent successes using GWA we believe that shifting our design to exploit the availability of high density SNPs will dramatically speed gene discovery by substantially reducing the genomic region of interest nominated in our linkage-based study. Using alternative funding we have begun this process of high-density genotyping. Because of power issues due to multiple testing inherent in GWA it is necessary to expand our original sample to obtain sufficient power for gene identification. By adding 500 new individuals from the same large pedigrees and completing the high-density genotyping in the original sample (n=1000) we will have 80 percent power to detect relatively small genetic effects on brain-related endophenotypes. Our specific aims for this independent R01 are to: 1) extend our existing study by performing high quality brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological examinations on an additional 500 Mexican Americans who are members of 30 previously studied extended families 2) perform GWA analysis to prioritize potential genes involved in brain structure/function using 1 million SNPs genotyped on all 1500 individuals 3) increase our genome-wide transcriptional profile data by performing identical assays on the additional 500 samples to identify genes whose lymphocyte-derived expression levels correlate with measures of brain structure/function in the total sample 4) identify the most likely functional variations within the five best empirically nominated candidate genes by resequencing 192 founder individuals and 5) confirm the strongest association in an independent data set. Combining these new samples with those currently being collected represents the most cost effective and rapid approach for the discovery of genes associated with brain-related traits. The co-principal investigators on this single application include Dr. David Glahn University of Texas HSC at San Antonio and Dr. John Blangero Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research. If funded our data and biomaterials will be incorporated into the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative making them available to qualified researchers in the wider scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain-related mental diseases are a major public health burden whose biology is still largely unknown. By identifying genes involved in brain function and structure we will provide novel biological candidates for the determinants of such diseases and thus improve potential for intervention. The use of genome-wide association methods should significantly speed gene discovery.              ","691744",

Csr includes CsrA an RNA binding protein that regulates translation and/or modulates the stability of target mRNAs. CsrB and CsrC are non-coding regulatory RNAs that antagonize CsrA by sequestering this protein and CsrD is a protein that specifically targets CsrB and CsrC for degradation by RNase E. In E. coli CsrA affects metabolism physiology motility and multicellular behavior on a broad scale repressing certain genes expressed during the transition from exponential to stationary phase growth and activating various genes expressed during exponential phase. CsrA homologues are widely distributed among eubacteria and regulate the expression of virulence factors in both plant and animal pathogens. Thus the proposed studies will also provide fundamental understanding of the regulation of bacterial physiology and pathogenesis and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches for bacterial infections. The specifc aims of this proposal are: 1) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CsrA activates or inhibits gene expression. This aim will include an analysis of CsrA-mediated autoregulation as well as an investigation into the factors that influence the stability of CsrA target transcripts. 2) Establish the Csr global regulon using a combination of bioinformatic genomic molecular genetic and biochemical approaches. 3) Stoichiometric and structural characterization of CsrA-RNA complexes. This aim will include NMR structural determination of a model CsrA target RNA as well as the structure of CsrA-RNA complexes by X-ray crystallography. 4) Elucidate the molecular mechanism of CsrD action.

Clinical risk predictors of future diabetes mellitus (DM) are imperfect. A robust set of predictors of at risk individuals is of particular importance because the delay or prevention of type 2 DM may be possible via both behavioral and pharmacological approaches. One new avenue for the identification of novel disease markers is being opened by the global analysis of the human metabolome. An emerging set of technologies based on mass spectrometry enables the monitoring of hundreds of metabolites from biological samples. A second new avenue for the identification of novel risk factors is afforded by genome- wide association studies (GWAS) which have begun to yield robust reproducible genetic associations with type 2 DM. Many of these genetic variants have occurred in heretofore unsuspected pathways. Indeed many variants are not correlated with intermediate glycemic traits such as fasting glucose or insulin. Thus there is an urgent need to characterize the metabolic consequences of these newly discovered genetic variants and to identify additional genetic variants that are more closely related to pathogenic metabolic signatures. We postulate that combining metabolomic genetic and clinical data in human populations will provide a rich opportunity to identify metabolite signatures of those destined to develop overt DM. To achieve this goal we will leverage the unique resources of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) a well- characterized prospective cohort in which GWAS and comprehensive metabolomic profiling are possible. In Specific Aim 1 we will document changes in plasma metabolite levels with glucose loading in individuals with and without insulin resistance. Building upon preliminary studies already performed we will profile 500 plasma metabolites in samples obtained from ~3100 FHS subjects before and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We will then assess the relation of two phenotypes insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance with the change in plasma metabolite levels in response to OGTT. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine whether changes in plasma metabolite concentrations with glucose loading predict the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. We will use multivariable regression to examine the relation between plasma metabolites and 2 endpoints: incident DM and insulin resistance. In Specific Aim 3 we will characterize the genetic determinants of metabolites associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. We will (A) analyze the relation of metabolites identified in Aims 1 and 2 with common genetic variants using GWAS and (B) characterize differences in plasma metabolite concentrations in individuals with and without validated genetic polymorphisms associated with DM. Thus our goal is to identify novel markers of preclinical disease and illuminate pathways contributing to DM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current treatments for diabetes (DM) are only partially successful in part because they are based on limited knowledge of its root causes. Furthermore there is no way to accurately predict who will develop DM thus limiting our ability to intervene effectively. Our goal is to use genetics and other systematic approaches to develop novel markers of preclinical disease and illuminate our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms in DM.        ","17583",

The derivation of cellular liver transplants from embryonic stem (ES) cells as an alternative source of tissue would need to be both autologous and free of the genetic disease requirements that are not easily surmountable and also ethically controversial with ES cells derived from potentially viable fertilized or patient-specific somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos. One approach to produce autologous disease-free ES cells from patients that may resolve these problems is the derivation of uniparental embryonic stem cells from the patient's gametes. Uniparental embryos such as parthenogenetic embryos have limited developmental capacity due to genomic imprinting but can produce ES cell lines. We have established that hematopoietic stem cells derived from murine uniparental ES cells can reconstitute adult hematopoiesis with no apparent pathology. To investigate the potential of uniparental cells for liver replacement we now propose to use maternally (oocyte)-derived (parthenogenetic /gynogenetic) and paternally derived (androgenetic; two sperm genomes) fetal ES cell derivatives to functionally repopulate the liver in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) deficient adults. As a therapeutic approach we will also transplant hepatic progenitors derived in vitro from uniparental ES cells. As each gamete contains a subset of the genome diploid uniparental embryos are homozygous at a proportion of loci that are heterozygous in the gamete donor. This can be exploited to produce patient-derived ES cells without an errant allele (including large genetic lesions) in diseases associated with heterozygosity. Using the heterozygous phenotypic PiZ mouse model for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency we will perform a proof of principle experiment involving elimination of the PiZ locus in uniparental ES cells. For patients of recessive genetic disorders mutant allele-free uniparental ES cell lines derived from parents or siblings could provide immune-compatible transplantable tissue since MHC homozygous mutant allele-free uniparental lines with a matched subset of the recipient's MHC could be identified. Using mouse strains with different MHC loci we will investigate the engraftment of MHC homozygous cellular liver transplants in MHC heterozygous recipients i.e. determine the relevance of hybrid resistance.This proposal will investigate the capacity of embryonic stem cells derived from oocytes or sperm only to be used for liver transplantation and correction of genetic liver diseases. These embryonic stem cells would be derived from the respective patient's sperm or oocytes and thus limit rejection problems associated with the use of existing embryonic stem cell lines.      ","86625",

As a case in point medical errors persist at a distressing rate and incur enormous costs despite extensive publicity and considerable research. Because healthcare is a complex sociotechnical system these medical errors generally have no simple single cause. Instead the errors typically are the result of system failures that involve many individuals many contributing factors and encompass multiple levels of the health care system. In our previous research we have shown that computational modeling using OrgAhead is a valuable research tool for dealing with these types of complex multi-level problems. Building on that work we propose using a network-based theory of organizations as complex adaptive systems to develop desktop decision support tools and methods that help managers (a) assess their unit's current performance and (b) predict the impact of potential unit innovations to improve targeted safety and quality outcomes. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop a simple virtual environment that allows nurse managers to assess through a dynamic network analysis decision support tool (DyNADS) the organizational health of their patient care units and then engage in strategic planning by using automated ""what-if"" analysis techniques to test on the virtual units the likelihood of potential innovations to improve their actual units' safety and quality outcomes. Specific aims are to:   1. Refine and streamline data collection requirements for DyNADS to fit within the unit management workflow.   2. Design a prototype desktop dynamic network analysis decision support tool (DyNADS) that facilitates: (a) identifying structures or communication patterns that are the basis for system failures in acute care settings and (b) testing the likelihood of potential innovations to improve safety and quality outcomes.   3. Evaluate DyNADS' validity scalability and usefulness through a field test.  4. Evaluate the feasibility of implementing DyNADS or nursing units.      ","42768",

Computational models that incorporate all of these biological determinants are needed to accurately predict tumor biology and patient prognosis. In this project we will identify human-mouse conserved biology by integrating multiple data types coming from human tumors human and mouse cell lines and mouse tumor models and then use these data to build improved outcome predictors for breast cancer patients that can be used to help make treatment decisions. We will combine high dimensional tumor genomic data (expression copy number and MicroRNA) with information from cell-cell interactions and stress responses for outcome predictions. The mouse tumor models provide a rich resource for the identification of important tumor biology (i.e. modules) that will increase our knowledgebase regarding carcinogenesis in both species and these modules will be objectively tested for prognostic value in humans. We recently developed a risk of relapse predictor based upon a Cox proportional hazards model that showed good discriminatory accuracy across all breast cancer patients. A unique aspect of our model was that it combined gene expression (5 intrinsic subtypes) and clinical variables (tumor size and node status) and was accurate in predicting 7 year relapse probabilities. We will test the predictive value of new genomic modules identified in this project by adding them to this Cox model and determining if they improve outcome predictions. These new modules will be derived from an existing database of ~1000 human breast tumors with gene expression and clinical data and a complementary database of gene expression from 250 mouse mammary tumors from 23 different models. Even this large comparative resource is inadequate to identify most biologically relevant modules and therefore these data will be supplemented with new data on MicroRNAs tumor DNA copy number changes experimental data on tumor microenvironment and stress responses obtained from in vitro cell line co-cultures and whole mouse studies. An important facet of our analytic method is that it can use data from experiments performed in mice translate these to humans and then simultaneously utilize disparate data types (like gene expression and clinical variables) in a single evaluative framework. Emphasizing conserved features across species the aggregation of gene-level information into modules and the inclusion of multiple genomic data types with clinical features should provide improvements in predicting patient outcomes and will result in advances in our understanding of breast cancer biology that may become predictive biomarkers.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predicting breast cancer patient outcomes remains challenging despite many advances in the postgenomic era.

Even if we could prevent cigarette smoking and exposure to other carcinogens today hundreds of thousands of lung cancer cases would still need to be treated in the next decades. A major current effort in the lung cancer field is to detect and treat lung cancer at earlier stages to improve the survival of patients. In addition identifying novel drug targets would allow for the development of more efficacious therapeutic strategies against lung tumors. Finally lung cancer patients are treated following well-established protocols that most often do not take into account the genetic diversity of their tumors and very little is known about prognostic factors for individual lung cancer patients. A better knowledge of the molecular events in lung cancer development would help to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers in lung cancer patients. Rb p53 and Kras are among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. In particular combinations of mutations in these three genes are often found in human lung cancer and define important clinical subtypes. Using advanced gene-targeting approaches we and others have generated genetically engineered mice with mutations in these genes. These mutant mice develop tumors that closely resemble human lung tumors and provide a genetically tractable system to study lung tumorigenesis in vivo. Here we propose to use comparative gene expression analysis to define genotype-specific oncogenic signatures using these mouse models of lung cancer. Our specific goals are: - To develop gene expression signatures from mouse tumors and compare them to human data to identify new human lung cancer subtypes. The validation of subtype-specific genes from these signatures will be performed using human tissue arrays. - To identify key regulators and ""drivers"" of these gene expression signatures using conventional bioinformatics approaches as well as a novel ""event"" centered gene network that we will develop. In particular we will introduce the notion of ordered causal events in lung cancer gene networks to identify key nodes in these gene networks. - To functionally analyze potential key regulators of these lung cancer gene expression signatures. To this end we will first use gene expression-based high throughput screening to identify such regulators and we will then test their functional role in lung cancer development in vivo. The overall goal of our work is to begin to define critical pathways that are required for genotype-specific oncogenesis. Characterization of these pathways may provide a useful approach for identification of new approaches for diagnosis prognosis and targeted therapy in lung cancer patients.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to use a novel gene network to identify molecular events downstream of key oncogenic ""driver"" mutations for lung cancer by comparing gene expression profiles in lung tumors from genetically defined mouse models to gene expression profiles from human lung tumors.

Recent work from the laboratories of the applicants and from other centers leads to the conclusion that clonal evolution in aplastic states arises in the context of ongoing stem cell damage through a process of clonal selection and adaptation. In the past year the two applicants have each independently developed a unique murine model of clonal evolution in Fanconi anemia. The applicants propose herein to use these models to identify the earliest molecular events involved in clonal evolution of FA stem cells. These models provided material for genome wide expression analyses which when combined with our recently completed studies on the human bone marrow transcriptome have not only confirmed the adaptive nature of clonal selection in this disease but have yielded common candidate genes the potential of one of which (HoxA9) to facilitate clonal selection of adapted cells has been established in preliminary studies. A second family of genes has potential to explain the molecular underpinnings of the random aneuploidy that is characteristic of MDS in FA. Collectively our goals are to identify genetic and epigenetic causes of clonal evolution in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate that by doing so we can use the knowledge to develop strategies for prevention of clonal evolution in patients at high risk. We will use murine and human FA cells that have not undergone clonal evolution (FAAPL) and FA cells that have clonally evolved (FACL).    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application seeks to identify molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of myeloid malignancies and aplastic anemia.

Cancer cells have been detected in the blood and bone marrow of patients and it isbelieved that some of these cells may indeed be cancer stem cells; which initiate cancer growth in other placesin the body. Our experiments intend to prove that these cells are indeed cancer stem cells and we also hope toidentify means of eliminating them by directly targeting their unique properties. Understanding cancer stemcell properties and ways to eliminate them will eventually lead to preventative therapy ensuring that all hiddencancer cells are destroyed before they spread and grow.1.

Clinical studies examining the predictive and prognostic significance of these cells have been limited by several factors including variable methods for isolating single cells from tissues the need for multiple markers to distinguish committed from undifferentiated cells and the availability of fresh tissue from patients for study. Originating from the primary tumor circulating tumor cells (in the blood) and disseminated tumor cells (in the bone marrow) are attractive cancer stem cell candidates and practical clinical surrogates for cancer stem cell study because they exist as single cells and can be quantified using available FDA approved technology. Therefore we propose a translational strategy to examine primary circulating and disseminated tumor cells from breast cancer patients to test our central hypothesis that circulating and disseminated tumor cells present in the blood and bone marrow of non-metastatic breast cancer patients represent cancer stem cells which are precursors to distant metastases and potential targets for novel treatment. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary data from an ongoing IRB-approved clinical protocol that demonstrates disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with non-metastatic breast cancer are positive for the expression of cancer stem cell markers of tumor initiating capacity; CD44+CD24- and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1). Translational aims are based on three IRB protocols and tailored to the material collected treatment approach and patient population in each trial. The translational work represents an established multidisciplinary collaboration between Massimo Cristofanilli MD Breast Medical Oncology James Reuben PhD Hematopathology and Wendy Woodward MD-PhD Clinical and Experimental Breast Radiation Oncology. The goals are 1) Measure CTCs and DTCs in patients without metastatic disease assess these cells for stem cell features and correlate these to outcome and ALDH1 staining in the primary; 2) Measure CTCs and primary tumor stem cells in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and correlate response to therapy between these measures as well as transplant and culture primary biopsy material for molecular studies; 3) Determine key mediators of -catenin and Notch-1 crosstalk in radioresistance of cancer stem cells and test inhibition of these pathways as radiosensitizers. In these studies we hope to demonstrate that CTCs/DTCs are prognostic and predictive surrogates for cancer stem cells that are easily accessible for examination on the single cell level. This approach could be used to select patients for individualized therapy using targeted sensitizing agents based on the proposed preclinical studies.      ","465744",

One explanation is that a rare sub-population of cancer stem cells with tumorigenic potential is intrinsically resistant to therapy. Consistent with this we have shown for the first time clinically in human breast cancer patients that residual tumors after chemotherapy are 1) enriched for the tumorigenic CD44+/CD24-/low population 2) show enhanced mammosphere-forming efficiency (MSFE) and 3) display an increase in outgrowths in xenograft transplants in immunocompromised SCID/Beige mice thus suggesting their increased tumorigenicity. Our recent data from paired human breast cancer samples indicates that standard therapy eliminates dividing daughter cells so that samples obtained after therapy are enriched for CD44+/CD24-/low putative ""breast cancer stem cells"" that have the ability to self-renew in mammosphere cultures and to give rise to tumors upon xenograft transplantation. We have identified a cancer stem cell signature of CD44+/CD24-/low mammosphere-forming cells derived from human breast cancer biopsies. The top canonical pathways identified include Notch and PI3-AKT and other signaling pathways. We now propose a series of preclinical and clinical studies to directly test the hypothesis that breast cancer stem cells can be specifically targeted by inhibitors of the Notch PI3-AKT and other pathways. A unique component of our studies is the availability of human biopsy samples obtained before and after targeted therapy in breast cancer patients with residual disease after preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapy. Specific Aims and Study Design 1. To determine whether suppression of identified self-renewal and treatment resistance pathways can improve existing cancer therapies in preclinical models. Beginning with Notch and PI3-AKT inhibitors we will determine if these will improve efficacy of conventional therapy using MSFE and human breast cancer xenograft models. Next we will target the top ~300 genes differentially expressed in our stem cell signature by ordered lentivirus-based shRNA libraries designed to allow genetic ""knockdown"" of every gene in the human genome as well as the development of high-throughput functional genomic assays of stem cell self-renewal. 2. To conduct novel clinical trials to determine whether suppressing stem cell self-renewal and treatment resistance pathways can improve existing cancer therapies in breast cancer patients. Clinical trials with novel inhibitors of stem cell self-renewal (Notch and PI3) have been planned. We propose to include patients with advanced breast cancers refractory to conventional therapy as these women have a poor expected clinical outcome and who are most likely to benefit from therapies targeting self-renewal pathways. 3. To perform correlative studies using breast cancer biopsy specimens from these clinical trials. Correlative studies using human cancer biopsies from these trials will be conducted e.g. a decrease in stem cell markers and tumorigenic potential as well as downstream effects of inhibition of the relevant pathways.        ","475325",

This tremendous accomplishment has sparked an incredible international community effort to catalog human genetic variation and to relate this variation to human phenotypes with the ultimate payoff of more personalized medicine. While the latest technologies provide unprecedented ability to conduct genome- wide association studies (GWAS) to identify individual susceptibility loci for a given human disease GWAS are underpowered (due to the multiple hypotheses testing problem) to screen for the multiple gene-gene interactions conferring susceptibility in humans. To overcome this limitation in this application we propose a novel cross-species (yeast-to-human) comparative systems genetics strategy to identify gene-gene and pathway-pathway interactions underlying human breast cancer susceptibility. Specifically we hypothesize that cellular sensitivity to DNA damage can be used as an intermediate phenotype for breast cancer susceptibility and that genes and pathways that synergize with defects in the DNA damage response pathway will also synergize to produce breast cancer susceptibility in humans. In Aim 1 we will leverage existing and emerging data from our genome-wide screens in yeast (R01 CA 129604-01A1 Phenotype-based approach to find gene interactions underlying breast cancer risk; PI: Paulovich) to identify gene-gene interactions likely to underlie susceptibility for breast cancer in humans. Putative human orthologs of interacting yeast genes will be identified using sophisticated data analysis tools. An integrative genomics analysis will then be used to further prioritize gene pairs with high probability of contributing to breast cancer susceptibility based on genomics datasets and networks derived from human breast cancers. Although model organisms can be genetically altered and their environments manipulated to test predictions about contributions of specific gene variants to risk there are limitations of single or multiple gene knockout or mutant approaches as the sole means to test predictions; hence in Aim 2 we will test the functional significance in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) of synthetic or synergistic gene-gene interactions discovered in yeast and prioritized in Aim 1. In Aim 3 gene- gene interactions functionally verified in HMEC will be tested for association with breast cancer susceptibility using existing and emerging GWAS datasets on human breast cancer. The premise of using sensitivity to DNA damage as an intermediate phenotype is reasonable given the abundance of evidence that defects in this pathway cause germline predisposition to breast cancer. This work will complement and extend the current GWAS studies since significant increases in risk may only be apparent when variant alleles are considered in combination (epistasis) and hence these risk alleles will be frequently missed in GWA studies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is relevant to public health for two reasons. First it will test a novel paradigm for discovering gene-gene and pathway-pathway interactions underlying breast cancer susceptibility in humans.

The median age of survival in CF is only 37 years but there is a broad range of disease severity in the lung even among patients with identical CFTR genotypes including ?F508 homozygotes. Robust twin/sib studies conclude that genetic factors must play a critical role in disease severity. Two transformational studies of twins and sibs assessed environmental versus genetic influences and both concluded that genetic factors play a major or even majority role in lung disease severity and heritability estimates ranged from 0.54 to 0.89. Early candidate gene studies to identify CF modifiers were limited by small sample size and poorly defined phenotypes. These limitations have been addressed by a North American CF Genetic Consortium which includes study groups at UNC/CWRU Johns Hopkins and Toronto. Genetic Modifier Consortium patients are now being tested in a whole-genome scan (Illumina 610K Quad). This RFA now provides the opportunity to study the role of gene expression variation in CF lung disease and the integrated analysis of SNPs/CNVs and expression data. This project holds great promise for defining a robust molecular phenotype for CF lung disease and we will be uniquely positioned to develop an integrated view of molecular mechanisms underlying CF lung disease severity. Since most CF patients are now diagnosed by neonatal screening each CF patient could have a molecular signature and associated risk established early in life. Taken together expression data and whole genome SNP data in the same CF patients are likely to spawn a variety of biological and clinical research activity in CF (and other) lung diseases and provide unprecedented opportunities for novel prognostic and therapeutic interventions in CF. The identification of molecular mechanisms relevant to lung disease severity in CF is also likely to be relevant to more common lung diseases such as asthma and COPD as has already been shown for variants and differential gene expression in TGF1.      ","758962",

As many as one in five South Africans is HIV positive and there are an estimated 1500 new HIV infections in South Africa each day. Research consistently shows that alcohol is closely related to HIV transmission risks in southern Africa although most research in drinking establishments has focused on men. Our proposed multilevel analysis is grounded in Social Action Theory and incorporates factors derived from three levels of analysis: structural/environmental social/interpersonal and individual. We propose collecting environmental level data from two informal drinking places (shebeens) two larger drinking places (taverns) and businesses that sell and do not serve alcohol (bottle stores) in two racial/cultural communities (Black Africans of Xhosa heritage and mixed racial background Coloured) for a total of 12 drinking establishments. Data will be collected from key informants (n=20) alcohol serving business owners managers and servers (n=60) interviews (n=240) and cross-sectional surveys (n= 900) of men and women drinkers and a prospective cohort of women (n=300). Assessments at the structural/environmental social/interpersonal and individual levels will be collected at 4 time points: baseline 4- 8- and 12-months. We will test the associations of alcohol serving establishment characteristics socioeconomic conditions gender dynamics social norms and collective efficacy and individual risk characteristics including alcohol expectancies and risk reduction self-efficacy of women who drink in the target settings. We will use multilevel modeling to test whether contextual factors including socioeconomic conditions and drinking setting characteristics directly predict social interactions and social dynamics of women's risks for HIV/AIDS. We will also examine characteristics of drinking settings propensity for gender violence and men's gender attitudes in relation to women's alcohol-related HIV risks. We also propose conducting a series of intervention development activities that will be informed by our multilevel study providing a new intervention model as the study end-product available for subsequent testing. The proposed study will therefore directly meet the urgent need for new multilevel HIV prevention intervention models for women who drink in alcohol serving establishments in South Africa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol is associated with sexual risks for HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Research has shown that men who drink at alcohol serving establishments are at high risk for HIV transmission but little research has focused on South African women who drink in these settings. Structural/environmental social/interpersonal and individual level factors influence alcohol use and risk behavior although the complex interplay of these factors has not been examined among women who drink. This study will test a multilevel model of alcohol and HIV risks among African and Coloured women in South Africa using a prospective study design. Multilevel risk factors will be examined at small informal alcohol serving establishments (shebeens) larger more formal drinking places (taverns) and alcohol sales business (bottle stores).

In the US this condition causes over 700000 hospitalizations per year and leads to $20-26 billion in annual health care expenditures. There is currently no cure for COPD and the limited therapies currently available mainly reduce symptoms rather than reverse the disease or prevent its progression. While the role cigarette smoke plays in COPD is undisputed the mechanism by which inhaled smoke contributes to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. One of the major barriers to the development of new approaches to diagnose and manage COPD is the clinical heterogeneity displayed by COPD patients. While COPD has been defined as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible there are diverse clinical radiographic and pathologic findings that likely reflect different underlying molecular and pathogenic disease mechanisms. Cigarette smoke causes an airway-wide ""field of injury"" and gene expression in bronchial airway cells of smokers obtained by brushings at bronchoscopy reflects both this injury and subsequent disease-specific processes. This proposal examines the hypothesis that determining the gene-expression profile of airway epithelial cells in individuals with and without COPD will provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of COPD and specific COPD-related traits including degree of airflow obstruction emphysema small airways disease and the rate of disease progression. Alterations in airway gene and microRNA expression will be used to define the underlying pathways that are perturbed by COPD and to define novel molecular subclasses of COPD that may contribute to the clinical diversity of the disease. Patterns of airway gene expression will be linked to longitudinal decline in lung function providing a way to identify individuals at risk for rapid disease progression and an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for variations in their rate of functional decline. How the expression of COPD-related airway gene-expression profiles change during disease progression within lung tissue will elucidate dynamic disease-related processes. The reversibility of these gene expression changes upon treatment with various existing and novel COPD drugs will determine whether airway gene expression signatures can serve as an intermediate marker for evaluating COPD treatments. Finally the identification of heritable genetic variants that influence the underlying pathways that are responsible for COPD-specific gene expression changes and testing their ability to identify individuals at risk for COPD will result in genetic markers of disease susceptibility and progression. The proposed work applies powerful whole-genome exon level and microRNA expression platforms and a variety of novel computational methodologies to samples from a series of large unique and well-characterized existing cohorts and will result in an unprecedented and detailed view of the molecular processes that contribute to COPD pathogenesis.

While critically important and widely accepted these clinical definitions and classification did not account for a large number of patients that presented with intermediate phenotypes or some less common features and overlooked the complexity and potential overlap of some of the manifestations of emphysema/COPD and IPF. In this proposal we plan to use the lung Tissue Resource Consortium (LTRC) a large NIH sponsored collection of well characterized lung samples from patients with IPF and COPD to define known disease phenotypes and discover new disease phenotypes using gene expression microarrays a novel platforms for high throughput parallel PCR (SmartChip) as well as novel computational approaches. We hypothesize that by applying gene expression profiling and advanced computational approaches to a large enough and well characterized cohort of samples of IPF and emphysema/COPD we will be able to identify disease relevant gene expression modules that are highly distinct reproducible and characteristic of disease phenotypes that go beyond current disease definitions.    We will address this hypothesis by performing the following specific aims:    1. To determine the gene expression signatures that globally characterize COPD and IPF.  2. To identify disease microenvironments in which disease profiles diverge or converge and their relevance to known disease phenotypes  3. To generate a disease relevant module map of IPF and COPD.  4. To validate module networks predictions on an independent sample set of COPD and IPF samples using the custom designed molecular phenotyping assay (PulmoSmartChip).    (End of Abstract)        ","770981",

This proposal specifically seeks to understand the significance of microRNA (miRNA) and piwi interacting protein RNA (transposon silencing RNA; piRNA) signatures in smoking-related lung disease marked by chronic obstructruction (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COPD) and lung parenchymal loss (emphysema). Tobacco smoke induced COPD/emphysema is now the fourth leading cause of death in the industrialized world and is expected shortly to become the third. Despite smoke cessation a subset of all smokers ultimately develop COPD/emphysema suggesting that the chronic inflammation that underlies disease is to a large degree determined by genetic factors. Because COPD/emphysema is often diagnosed at a late stage when irreversible lung destruction has resulted in significantly impaired lung function and quality of life markers of severe lung disease that appear early in the course of COPD/emphysema and which can be used to predict rapid loss of lung function are needed. We have previously demonstrated that emphysema is associated with autoimmune CD4+ T cell and B cell responses directed against the major structural matrix protein of the lung elastin. Moreover T helper type 1 (Th1) cell-elicited chemokines including CXCL10 coordinate the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that ultimately lead to elastin destruction and the loss of lung structural integrity. Thus T cell but also B cell specific anti-elastin responses in smokers are potentially valuable indicators of later lung destruction but it remains unclear if these inflammatory markers develop sufficiently early in asymptomatic smokers to provide clinically useful predictions. MiRNAs are 21nt RNA transcripts that bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs to suppress protein translation. Unique expression patterns of the approximately 460 known human miRNAs in diseases as diverse as leukemia prostate cancer the chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis have previously been shown to correlate with clinically significant outcomes. We hypothesize that unique expression patterns of lung miRNAs and closely related piRNAs correlate with inflammatory markers of anti-elastin autoimmunity. Moreover we postulate that lung miRNA markers of emphysema are recapitulated in peripheral blood of the same individuals and may be used to predict the onset of autoimmune dysfunction. To test these hypotheses we will establish primary miRNA and piRNA signatures within the human lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cell short transcriptomes that characterize smoking-induced COPD/emphysema; identify miRNA dependent regulatory pathways controlling human smoking-induced COPD/emphysema; and determine the miRNA and piRNA relationships that characterize human Th1 and Th17 cells.

Both genetic and autoimmune disorders targeting C7 result in chronic incurable blistering diseases. Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB) due to mutations in the gene that encodes for C7 (COL7A1) may be inherited in a dominant or recessive (RDEB) pattern. An acquired form of DEB epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is caused by IgG autoantibodies to C7 which perturbs the function of anchoring fibrils. Our overall goal is to understand the structure and function of C7 and anchoring fibrils. Biochemical methods could not provide enough purified C7 to do this work. We solved this problem by using a molecular biology approach and can now make milligram quantities of purified C7 and various domains and sub-domains allowing us to carry out extensive structure and function studies. We can transfect wild type COL7A1 or any published DEB mutation into C7-null cells and create C7 molecules that reflect a given DEB gene defect. Likewise we can create DEB cells that reflect the biology of cells from DEB patients. We also have an in vivo human skin equivalent model to examine the quantity and quality of anchoring fibrils in designer skin equivalents made from RDEB cells RDEB gene-corrected cells or designed gene-defective cells. We also developed a new murine model for EBA and directly demonstrated the pathogenic activities of human and rabbit anti-C7 autoantibodies. In this proposal using these novel reagents we will study the structure and function of RDEB C7 molecules including matrix and cell binding sites exportation from their cell of origin resistance to protease digestion triple helix and anti-parallel dimer formation disulfide bonding and the formation of anchoring fibrils in vivo. We will create RDEB cells harboring COL7A1 mutations known to result in the production of an abnormal C7 and examine the cell biology of designer DEB cells. We will define for the first time the ""pathogenic"" versus ""marker non-pathogenic"" segments of C7 using our newly developed murine EBA model. By immunoabsorption of anti-C7 antibodies against domains and sub-domains of C7 we will determine the smallest pathogenic EBA epitopes on C7 and evaluate the feasibility of peptide epitope decoy therapy for EBA. Lastly we found that C7 strongly promotes keratinocyte migration and markedly accelerates wound closure when delivered to murine and human skin wounds. We will identify the C7 domains that are essential for promoting wound closure and reveal the molecular mechanisms by which C7 promotes wound healing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type VII (anchoring fibril) collagen (C7) in skin can be perturbed by a heritable gene defect or by an acquired autoantibody against it both of which cause incurable scarring blistering skin diseases. We will elucidate the structure and function of C7 and determine how perturbations of C7 cause skin blisters and how C7 promotes wound closure.

In doing so the researchers aim to develop a refined mathematical description regarding the molecular basis for olfactory transduction and adaptation within vertebrate ORNs. This is an important goal not only because olfaction shapes animal behavior and social ecology but also because similar molecular mechanisms are implicated in olfactory disease. One of the current challenges in neuroscience research is bridging the temporal scales of biochemical and neural processes. Olfaction provides a convenient model system for studying how single neurons can leverage the timing of molecular events to process information. Subsequent to odor presentation a G-protein-coupled signal transduction cascade is activated within the ORN cilia leading to current influx. Ultimately ORNs generate action potentials which are the primary information transmitted to the olfactory bulb. A successful model of the ORN must therefore be able to illustrate and predict the molecular processes underlying both the slow (transduction) and fast (action potential) currents during stimulation. The applicants' model is unique among the existing models in its ability to accurately predict the adaptive responses of ORNs to repetitive stimuli the oscillatory responses during sustained stimulation and the desensitization following a single brief odorant pulse. This model has recently been expanded to include the generation of action potentials. Mutant mouse lines which are currently available and will be created will be used to probe the relation of these components to transduction activity through computational modeling of electrophysiological recordings of the mutant ORNs.       ","167789",

Signal transduction pathways are critical for information storage and alterations in key signaling molecules such as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway modify both hippocampus-dependent learning and a form of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Alterations in these signaling pathways play a critical role in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as alcoholism depression schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Despite this clinical relevance little is known about how signaling pathways respond differentially to distinct temporal and spatial patterns of synaptic input. The dynamics of PKA localization to subcellular compartments by A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) provides a potential mechanism for such spatial and temporal specificity. We propose an innovative and transformative set of experiments to investigate the critical role of multi-protein complexes involving PKA and AKAPs in neuronal information storage and synaptic plasticity. SPECIFIC AIM 1. Define the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in the temporal sensitivity of late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Fluorescent imaging electrophysiology biochemistry and computational modeling will be utilized to measure the level of cAMP and PKA activity after LTP inducing stimuli. These integrated experiments and modeling will evaluate the role of NMDA and D1 receptor signaling in long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and will evaluate the temporal sensitivity of interactions between signaling pathways activated by these receptors. SPECIFIC AIM 2. Define the spatial specificity of biochemical signaling mechanisms underlying L-LTP induction in hippocampal neurons. Computational modeling fluorescent imaging and electrophysiology approaches will be utilized to measure L-LTP and gradients of cAMP and PKA activity in the presence or absence of inhibitors of PKA anchoring. Successful completion of the research will form the basis for investigating how alterations in this pathway contributes to psychiatric disease such as schizophrenia and alcoholism.    ","363750",

Because several antiretrovirals cause insulin resistance and dyslipidemia the increased risk for atherosclerotic disease has been attributed primarily to these drugs. However evidence is emerging that suggest untreated HIV infection contributes significantly to the risk for future cardiovascular events. Inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction are key promoters of atherosclerosis in the general population. Vascular lesions in HIV-infected patients demonstrate increased leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium with elevated levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In cART-naIve patients levels of these adhesion molecules are increased and endothelial dysfunction is common. cART only partly reduces levels of these molecules and only partly restores endothelial function. Our novel preliminary data suggest that the anti-inflammatory drug pentoxifylline (PTX) may significantly improve flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery an in vivo measure of endothelial function in HIV-infected subjects by inhibiting leukocyte recruitment and adhesion. Using a cellular model we found that HIV-infected T cells upregulate endothelial MCP-1 and that PTX inhibits endothelial production of MCP-1. We will directly address a specific objective of RFA-HL-08-003 which is to ""examine the direct effects of HIV itself on the endothelium and identify any mitigating factors"" in the proposed collaborative studies. In this application we will address the central hypothesis that HIV-related inflammation induces endothelial cell dysfunction that is reversed with pentoxifylline. Our Specific Aims are (1) To determine the effects of pentoxifylline on endothelial function in HIV-infected subjects and (2) To analyze in vitro mechanisms by which HIV and PTX modulate endothelial cell activation and injury. We will investigate the utility of PTX to improve HIV-related endothelial dysfunction in therapeutic trials. We will also study the mechanism of HIV-induced endothelial dysfunction and the ability of PTX to reverse this process using our in vitro models. This research is both timely and significant because it will move beyond observational clinical research by involving both therapeutic trials and mechanistic investigations to identify novel causal relationships and pathologic mechanisms between inflammation and endothelial function. If pentoxifylline is found to be effective in improving endothelial function in the proposed studies then this inexpensive safe and widely available drug can be studied in larger trials to reduce cardiovascular endpoints in HIV-infected patients. The proposed research will determine if HIV infection damages the vascular endothelium the inner lining of blood vessels by increasing inflammation and if this damage can be reversed with the anti-inflammatory drug pentoxifylline. Both clinical trials and laboratory investigations will address these key issues.

The role of ethanol tolerance in sustaining excessive drinking behavior that consequently can lead to the development of ethanol dependence remains to be determined. Studies proposed in this application are responsive to the RFA (AA-08-009) in that they test a novel hypothesis related to the role of tolerance to the aversive properties of ethanol in the context of ethanol dependence. More specifically we propose that tolerance develops to the aversive properties of ethanol and that this tolerance in turn maintains excessive drinking in dependent animals. Moreover we hypothesize that an underlying mechanism for tolerance to the aversive properties of ethanol relates to neuroadaptation in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Our overall research strategy and approach involves employing a well-characterized mouse model of ethanol dependence that reliably produces excessive voluntary ethanol consumption. Using this model studies will be conducted to: (a) examine tolerance to the aversive properties of ethanol as defined by reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced condition taste aversion (Specific Aim I); (b) measure basal levels and the capacity for ethanol to stimulate extracellular levels of glutamate in the BLA (Specific Aim II); and (c) examine the effects of direct manipulation of BLA glutamatergic neurotransmission on ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion and drinking behavior (Specific Aim III) in ethanol dependent and non-dependent mice. The findings will fill a general void in the literature regarding the role of glutamate in the BLA for tolerance to the aversive consequences of ethanol and should delineate a potential link to increased risk for excessive ethanol consumption and increased relapse associated with dependence.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tolerance to the aversive properties of alcohol may facilitate increased consumption that in turn can lead to the development of dependence along with sustained excessive drinking.

Because antibiotic resistance patterns are strongly correlated with antibiotic use patterns multiple organizations have declared reductions in unnecessary antibiotic use to be critical components of efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. Among humans the vast majority of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are used to treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) that have a viral etiology. In particular despite the fact that numerous controlled trials have demonstrated no benefit of antibiotic therapy for patients with acute bronchitis the majority of patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis continue to receive antibiotic therapy across diverse treatment settings. Recently the National Committee on Quality Assurance adopted the proportion of adult visits diagnosed as acute bronchitis when an antibiotic was NOT prescribed as a quality measure within the HEDIS data set. Recent results from the HEDIS dataset emphasize the continued high rates of antibiotic prescribing for patients with acute bronchitis. One key factor driving overuse of antibiotics in the management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections-such as acute bronchitis-is diagnostic uncertainty and inaccurate risk estimation of underlying pneumonia in such patients. Recently our study team has observed substantial reductions in antibiotic prescribing following the incorporation of a diagnostic and treatment algorithm into an acute care setting. This acute cough management algorithm incorporates data on vital signs and symptoms distinguishing patients with community- acquired pneumonia from other patients with acute cough illness specifically those with acute bronchitis. The acute cough management algorithm has become even more valuable in recent years due to the introduction of quality measures that emphasize the timely administration of antibiotics for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Thus strong empirical evidence of the effectiveness of such an algorithm could lead to wide adoption of the algorithm and substantial improvements in antibiotic prescribing. The investigative team is proposing a unique partnership with Geisinger Health System a large integrated health network to implement and evaluate the algorithm. Utilizing a cluster-randomized trial design across 33 practice sites we will address the following aims: 1) To measure the reduction in antibiotic prescribing resulting from incorporation of the algorithm compared to usual care sites utilizing two different implementation strategies one poster-based and one electronic health record-based 2) To measure revisits delayed hospitalizations and net economic costs associated with algorithm implementation and 3) To evaluate local practice characteristics influencing the level of implementation and ultimate performance success at intervention sites. In a final component of the study the investigators will partner with NCQA to disseminate study results through the national network of participating plans and stimulate wide spread adoption of the algorithm and quality improvement methods.        ","332273",

However this risk may be partially explained by factors other than HIV or its treatment including higher rates of smoking alcohol abuse cocaine use hepatitis C infection and renal disease. Equally important major mechanisms of CVD among those with HIV likely differ from those without infection because lipid abnormalities occur abruptly--after initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and because of inflammatory effects of HIV and HCV toxic effects of alcohol and vasospasm due to cocaine. The Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) is an ongoing multicenter prospective study of 3227 veterans with HIV infection and 3240 age/race/site matched HIV uninfected controls. Teamed with internationally recognized experts in CVD we propose to supplement the rich clinical data available in this cohort with adjudicated CVD endpoints and biomarkers and measures of CVD risk including: dyslipidemia insulin resistance  markers of inflammation cardiac structural and functional abnormalities body composition changes subclinical atherosclerosis cardiac fitness and alterations associated with thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis. With these enriched data we will be uniquely positioned to determine whether: 1) HIV infection is an independent risk factor for CVD endpoints and whether HCV substance use and CART modify the association between HIV and CVD endpoints 2) biomarkers and measures of CVD risk are increased among those with HIV infection and CART nonadherence and 3) biomarkers and measures of CVD risk are increased among those with HCV infection and substance use. Importantly we will adjust for both CART adherence and competing risk since HIV infected individuals have a substantially higher mortality rate. The large well characterized older predominantly minority patient sample with excellent longitudinal follow up and high prevalence of HCV and substance use comprehensive pharmacy data and established access to comprehensive electronic medical records are important leveraged strengths of this application. The strong CVD expertise established analytic and mentoring skills of the VACS team and a multi-PI plan incorporating a promising new investigator ensure that this proposal will effectively advance our understanding of CVD outcomes and mechanisms among HIV infected and uninfected individuals.

Liver disease is recognized as anincreasingly important problem for the HIV population. Liver disease may be due to a variety offactors including co-infection with viral hepatitis alcohol abuse and antiretroviral hepatotoxicity.Liver disease is now a leading cause of death for patients with HIV. Hepatoxicity due to HAARTis also common and up to 30% of patients on HAART experience World Health Organizationgrade 3 liver enzyme elevations. Furthermore hepatoxicity from antiretroviral drugs leads toadverse patient outcomes either from fulminant hepatic failure or more commonly AIDSfollowing discontinuation of HAART. It is unknown why some but not all HIV patients developdrug induced liver injury from HAART. Relevant to this proposal alcohol/HAART interactionsare emerging as critically important factors. Recent research has shown that alcohol abuse isassociated with severe hepatotoxicity in patients on HAART. Importantly alcoholic liver diseaseand HAART induced liver injury share many potential mechanisms of injury. These includecytokine dysregulation mitochondrial dysfunction and proteasomal dysfunction. Through theseand other mechanisms alcohol and antiretroviral medications converge on the liver in anoverlapping fashion to produce hepatoxicity. Here we will study hepatotoxicity due toalcohol/HAART interactions to further define disease mechanisms and create therapeuticinterventions.","NIAAA","7591477","9/29/2008 12:00:00 AM","RFA-AA-08-013","1R01AA018016-01","1","R01","AA","018016","01"," ","WANG, JOE","9/30/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZAA1-BB(02)"," ","1902075","MCCLAIN, CRAIG J.","BARVE, SHIRISH S; EATON, JOHN W","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","057588857","E1KJM4T54MK6","057588857","E1KJM4T54MK6","US","38.215024","-85.760145","4679701","UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE","LOUISVILLE","KY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","402920001","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","273","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008","333000"," ","NIAAA","225000","108000"," ","  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is clear that alcohol abuse can alter/suppress immune function including CD4 T-lymphocyte depletion which can accelerate HIV progression. Subjects who consume alcohol may be more likely to develop certain infectious diseases which can complicate HIV examples being various types of pneumonia and tuberculosis. Moreover subjects who consume alcohol are more likely to participate in high-risk behaviors that increase the likelihood of acquiring HIV. Patients who consume alcohol also may be less compliant with their HIV therapy which can affect disease progression. The research focus of this grant is the potential impact of alcohol use/abuse as a co-factor for HIV therapy-induced hepatotoxicity. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996 the life expectancy of patients with HIV has increased significantly. However HAART is associated with significant hepatotoxicity. The severity of liver toxicity ranges from the absence of symptoms to liver decompensation and the reported incidence of severe liver toxicity after initiating HAART ranges from 2% to 18%. The mechanisms involved in HAART-derived hepatotoxicity are not well understood which makes its management more difficult. Some likely mechanisms of hepatotoxicity include proinflammatory cytokine production mitochondrial toxicity hypersensitivity reactions steatosis and insulin resistance immune reconstitution in HCV or HBV co-infected patients and proteasome inhibition (with dysregulated cytokine metabolism and mitochondrial and proteasome dysfunction serving as the focus of this proposal). The long-term goals of this study are to: (1) define mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by a combination of drug therapy and alcohol abuse in HIV patients and (2) discover potential therapeutic interventions for HAART hepatotoxicity especially for patients in whom alcohol use/abuse may be a contributing factor. Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1. Evaluate the potential hepatotoxic interactions of alcohol and HAART medications using rapid in vitro hepatocyte screening technology; 2. Determine the effects of anti- HIV drugs (selected agents based on preliminary toxicity studies from SO#1 and clinical hepatotoxicity risk) on the development and progression of hepatotoxicity in mice and the drug interactions with chronic alcohol intake; and 3. Evaluate in a human translational component: a) mitochondrial and proteasome function and ex vivo cytokine production in subsets of HIV patients b) serial non-invasive measures of mitochondrial and proteasome function and cytokine production in patients who develop HAART hepatotoxicity and c) liver histology findings including markers of proteasome and mitochondrial function using a human translational approach from a cohort of HCV+HIV coinfected subjects enrolled in a prospective NIH study based at the University of Cincinnati. We postulate that the HAART and alcohol mediated metabolic complications of dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine production and mitochondrial and proteasome dysfunction converge on the liver in an overlapping fashion to induce hepatotoxicity. In this proposal we test that hypothesis in a novel translational approach and we evaluate unique therapeutic interventions for this hepatotoxicity.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol abuse and HIV are important health problems. Liver disease is recognized as an increasingly important problem for the HIV population. Liver disease may be due to a variety of factors including co-infection with viral hepatitis alcohol abuse and antiretroviral hepatotoxicity.

Hepatotoxicity due to HAART is also common and up to 30% of patients on HAART experience World Health Organization grade 3 liver enzyme elevations. Furthermore hepatotoxicity from antiretroviral drugs leads to adverse patient outcomes either from fulminant hepatic failure or more commonly AIDS following discontinuation of HAART. It is unknown why some but not all HIV patients develop drug induced liver injury from HAART. Relevant to this proposal alcohol/HAART interactions are emerging as critically important factors. Recent research has shown that alcohol abuse is associated with severe hepatotoxicity in patients on HAART. Importantly alcoholic liver disease and HAART induced liver injury share many potential mechanisms of injury. These include cytokine dysregulation mitochondrial dysfunction and proteasomal dysfunction. Through these and other mechanisms alcohol and antiretroviral medications converge on the liver in an overlapping fashion to produce hepatotoxicity. Here we will study hepatotoxicity due to alcohol/HAART interactions to further define disease mechanisms and create therapeutic interventions.      ","333000",

This unresponsiveness to current therapeutics stems to a great degree from the innate resistance of malignant glioma cells to a broad range of cytotoxic agents. During our initial funding period we identified pre- and post-transcriptional mechanisms by which SF/HGF a multifunctional growth factor overexpressed by human malignant gliomas protects glioma cells against genotoxic agents. We showed that targeting SF/HGF in vivo induces glioma cell death sensitizes glioma to radiation therapy and markedly prolongs the survival of animals bearing SF/HGF- expressing brain tumors. These exciting discoveries contributed to the biological rationale for newly activated and planned clinical trials testing SF/HGF:c-Met pathway inhibitors in glioblastoma multiforme. The continued goals of this ambitious and collaborative research program are to identify biochemical and molecular mechanisms of glioma resistance to cytotoxicity and to further develop novel and potentially translatable strategies for overcoming resistance to death-inducing agents. Death receptor agonists (TRAIL FASL) are promising anti-tumor agents by virtue of their ability to selectively kill tumor cells. We have identified novel strategies (e.g. anisomycin-induce ribotoxic stress) for sensitizing glioma cells to death receptor agonists. In Aim #1 we will determine the mechanisms by which genotoxic and ribotoxic stresses induce DISC (death- initiating signaling complex) formation and caspase-8 activation. In Aim #2 we will determine mechanisms by which SF/HGF and other receptor tyrosine kinase pathways protect glioma cells against death receptor agonists. In contrast to kinases little is known of how phosphatases contribute to oncogenic signaling cascades. We found that two SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatases (SHIP1 and SHIP2) regulate glioma cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. In Aim #3 we will determine the mechanisms by which these lipid phosphatases modulate glioma cell death. In Aim #4 we will apply the novel death modulating strategies of Aims #1-3 to enhance anti-tumor responses to cytotoxic therapeutics (death receptor agonists chemotherapy and radiation therapy) in pre-clinical in vivo glioma models. The successful completion of these experiments will reveal novel mechanisms for enhancing glioma cell death and provide pre-clinical evidence supporting their therapeutic applicability.

The epidermis forms during late embryogenesis from a single-layered surface ectoderm and regenerates itself throughout postnatal life due to the presence of stem cells that are capable of recapitulating what happens during morphogenesis namely self-renewal and producing transiently amplifying (TA) progenitor cells that subsequently exit cell cycle and terminally differentiate as they migrate toward the skin surface. The parent R01 of this revision application uses traditional experimental approaches to study the role of Ovol transcription factors Ovol1 and Ovol2 in embryonic and postnatal epidermis. In this revision application we propose a systems biology approach to improve the understanding of how Ovol and their upstream (e.g. TGF-2 signaling) and downstream factors work in an integrated fashion to control epidermal development. Specifically we propose that the inclusion of Ovol proteins in the system is essential for the formation of an epidermis with a correct size and balanced lineage stages 2) Ovol2 specifically regulates epidermal stem cell proliferation by repressing c-Myc. We will 1) develop mathematical models at both cellular (stem TA and differentiated cells) and molecular (TGF-2 c-Myc Ovol) levels using constraints supplied by available data; 2) measure the actual number of stem TA and differentiated cells proliferation index and epidermal thickness under wild-type and Ovol-deficient conditions and use both in vitro and in vivo data to validate and refine our models; 3) simulate and analyze the models to make predications on the roles of Ovol and its interactions with other components such as c-Myc and TGF-2 and test the predications experimentally whenever possible; 4) if time permits incorporate into modeling additional complexity of the system such as spatial heterogeneity and additional molecular players such as Wnt/2-catenin and Notch signaling. Insights generated from these studies may well translate into testable hypotheses and long-term projects to understand not only epidermal development but also regeneration.      ","152584",

The incidence of VTE in these patients in further increased by the administration of anti-neoplastic drugs such as the chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin as well as combination therapies. However the mechanisms of VTE in cancer patients are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether an association exists between tissue factor (TF) activity in circulating microparticles (MPs) and venous thrombosis in patients with pancreatic or colon cancer and in tumor-bearing mice. MPs are small (<1 micron) membrane vesicles that are released from activated or apoptotic cells. Our general hypothesis is that chemotherapy drugs increase the release of TF-positive MPs from both tumor cells and host cells into the circulation and that an increase in the level of these MPs is associated with an increase in the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE in pancreatic and colon cancer patients and an increase in thrombus size in tumor-bearing mice. The proposal is divided into two aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the effect of treatment of tumor-bearing mice with chemotherapeutic drugs on circulating TF-positive MPs derived from tumor cells and different host cells as well as their role in a model of venous thrombosis. We will measure the levels of TF activity in isolated MPs in tumor-bearing mice treated with either gemcitabine or gemcitabine and cisplatin. We will use a series of novel mouse lines to distinguish between TF-positive MPs derived from i/ tumor versus host cells and ii/ different host cells (monocytes endothelial cells and platelets). These include HCV mice which express human TF in the absence of mouse TF and mice with various cell type-specific deletions of the TF gene generated using the Cre-loxP technology. Finally we will selectively analyze the role of either tumor cell- derived or host cell-derived TF-positive MPs in a model of venous thrombosis. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine if there is an association between TF activity in circulating MPs and VTE in patients with advanced pancreatic and colon cancer treated with anti-neoplastic drugs in a multi-center prospective observational study. Blood samples will be obtained from patients before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs. Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis will be assessed using compression ultrasound before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs. We will measure levels of TF activity in isolated MPs and determine if this is associated with asymptomatic and/or symptomatic VTE. We will also measure whole blood TF activity cellular origin of the TF-positive MPs and coagulation activation markers (thrombin anti thrombin complexes and D- dimer). The results of this study will determine the role of TF-positive MPs in venous thrombosis associated with cancer and chemotherapy. TF activity in isolated MPs may be a useful biomarker that can be used either alone or as an adjunctive biomarker in clinical predictive models of thrombotic risk in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Public Health Relevance: Development of blood clots in veins or venous thrombosis is a leading cause of death and disability among cancer patients. Both the underlying cancer and the chemotherapy used to treat it are known to increase the risk of venous thrombosis.

The incidence of total cases of VTE exceeds the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes in this country yearly while the incidence of VTE related deaths exceeds the number of myocardial infarction related deaths or stroke-related deaths. The incidence of VTE has been increasing with the aging of the population. Although the standard treatment of venous thromboembolism is anti-coagulation (and in some cases thrombolytic therapy) such treatment has significant bleeding potential is associated with thrombus progression in up to 30% of cases and does not prevent the long-term sequelae of the postthrombotic syndrome leg pain and swelling. Thus current treatment for venous thromboembolism does not result in optimal outcomes. We and others have demonstrated that a significant inflammatory response occurs with venous thromboembolism and that this inflammation has great influence over both thrombosis and vein wall fibrosis. Specifically P-selectin and its ligand receptor PSGL-1 appear to be strongly related to venous thrombogenesis as animals with high circulating level of P-selectin produce large venous thrombi while animals having gene deleted for P-selectin produce smaller thrombi. Although the role of VWF in venous thromboembolism is unclear venous thrombogenesis is influenced both by platelet and leukocyte adhesion and interactions between these elements interactions which are largely mediated by VWF. The current proposal addresses the role of VWF and P-selectin in basic studies in rodent models of venous thrombosis evaluates new aptamer inhibitors to VWF and P-selectin in a well established primate model of iliac vein thrombosis and evaluates biomarkers based on VWF and P- selectin for the diagnosis and follow-up of venous thrombosis in patients. This work will be the basis for eventual clinical application of such agents to the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. At the conclusion of this proposal we will have defined the role of VWF in venous thrombosis developed new aptamers to VWF and P-selectin tested these aptamers in models of venous thrombosis and determined the clinical value of new biomarkers.  public health relevance: Project Narrative: This proposal will determine the role of VWF and P-selectin in venous thrombosis in various animal models and in patients.

The parent R01 entitled In vivo Imaging of Growth Plate Dynamics funds a project using multiphoton microscopy to visualize molecular transport and cellular dynamics in growth plate cartilage of living mice. These studies have led to specific questions concerning oxygen levels within growth cartilage and their relationship both to cellular metabolism during chondrogenic differentiation and to signaling cascades leading to vascular invasion of cartilage from metaphyseal endothelial cells. Although for more than fifty years experimental data have suggested that there is an O2 gradient within the growth plate extracellular matrix (ECM) that has an essential role in chondrocytic differentiation definitive measurements still are inconclusive with conflicting results depending upon the methodology and the experimental system. What contributes to the ambiguity concerning O2 delivery to and movement within the growth plate cartilage ECM is that researchers are unable to directly map O2 concentrations within and around the region in vivo. Our BIRT proposal describes a highly interdisciplinary effort to produce oxygen-sensitive phosphors based on ruthenium complexes that are bright sensitive and stable. Tailored for multiphoton microscopy they will yield rapid micron-resolved images of O2 tension relatively deep into and around the growth cartilage of mice in vivo. Candidate sensors will be tested not only for their photophysical properties but also for how they interact and function within tissue. Probe developments will be applicable both to confocal and multiphoton microscopy and potentially whole animal ""molecular imaging"" systems. Our goal is to relate microenvironmental O2 levels to specific stages of chondrocytic differentiation and to correlate O2 gradients within the ECM with O2 availability levels in three different surrounding vascular routes. The multidisciplinary team assembled for this BIRT award combines the expertise of a chemist with experience in designing oxygen-sensing probes a nanotechnologist with skills in designing non-toxic delivery systems a physicist with expertise in using multiphoton microscopy for radiometric measurements and in vivo imaging systems and a biologist whose research has focused on cellular dynamics of the chondrocytic differentiation cascade in the postnatal animal.      ","163284",

Each of these receptive epithelia is implicated in detection of diverse compounds and evokes different behaviors. Traditionally the vomeronasal epithelium was thought to detect pheromones - chemicals released by a conspecific that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in the recipient - while the main olfactory epithelium was thought to mediate conscious perception of general odorants. In addition the trigeminal system is thought to detect potentially noxious substances which can elicit aversive responses such as a decrease in respiratory rate sneezing or coughing. However recent experiments - including those published by us in the current period of support - indicate that the traditional view on the role of these chemosensory systems needs to be revised because the main olfactory epithelium also appears to be involved in detecting pheromones and other semiochemicals - odors involved in animal communication (Baxi et al. 2006; Buck 2005; Lin et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2004). This novel aspect of chemoreception by the main olfactory system will be studied in this proposal. We will focus our proposal on our finding that the transient receptor channel M5 (TRPM5) an effector in the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway is expressed in a subset of olfactory sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium whose axons project to semiochemical-responsive glomeruli (Lin et al. 2007). We propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Test whether the PLC pathway participates in olfactory transduction by opening the TRPM5 channel in response to the increase in calcium elicited by odors. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that sensory input to the nose during the postnatal period affects TRPM5 expression in OSNs Aim 3. Test whether TRPM5 OSNs transmit information about semiochemicals to restricted areas of the MOB which project in turn to the medial amygdala - an area associated with reproductive and defensive behaviors.  In humans disorders of the sense of smell are encountered in diseases such as Alzheimer's (Doty 1991;Rawson 2000) bipolar depression (Hahn et al. 2005) and schizophrenia (Turetsky et al. 2003). This grant will study the basic mechanisms of olfactory transduction in olfactory sensory neurons as well as central projections of the olfactory system. This basic science study is performed within the context of the Rocky Mountain Taste and Smell Center (RMTSC) an entity dedicated to basic and clinically-relevant research on olfaction and taste. Drs. Restrepo and Finger are Co-Directors of the RMTSC. Clinically relevant work within the center includes work on schizophrenia Downs syndrome and brain inflammation. The clinical studies benefit greatly from solid basic science research and because of this we expect our current proposal to strengthen the clinically relevant work carried out by the RMTSC.

The impetus for this mandate was the evidence base supporting the effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions with injured patients on reducing alcohol use and risk of future injury as well as cost savings. However there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of SBI for drug use. In addition there is little evidence on the effectiveness of drug SBI on HIV risk and other health outcomes strongly associated with drug use.    This application proposes a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of brief advice (BA) brief motivational intervention with feedback (BMI) and brief motivational intervention with feedback and booster (BMI+B) in injured patients with drug problems. The setting is a trauma center serving a large and diverse patient population. The primary outcome of interest will be subsequent drug use. Other outcomes of interest include: (a) HIV-related risk behaviors (b) improved health outcomes including injury reduction (c) increased employment (d) decreased engagement in illegal behavior (e) increased substance abuse treatment utilization and (e) enhanced quality of life at three six and twelve month follow-ups.     This study will also examine the potential moderating and mediating effects of patient readiness to change use of experiential and behavioral processes of change and decisional balance considerations. In addition this project will examine implementation factors at the organizational level and the cost effectiveness of BA BMI and BMI+B.     Funding of the proposed study will increase the knowledge base with regard to the effectiveness of brief intervention among injured patients with drug use problems and thereby provide the ACS and the field with the necessary evidence base for screening brief intervention and referral for treatment for drug use problems in the trauma care setting.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More deaths illness and disabilities are attributed to substance misuse than any other preventable condition.

Prolonged use of opiates often produces the need for ever- increasing doses to maintain pain relief also known as analgesic tolerance. The mechanisms associated with analgesic tolerance are thought to due to morphine- induced cellular adaptations that produce a state of heightened pain or hyperalgesia. Recent studies suggest that opiates acting via the mu-opioid receptor can induce expression of chemokines and their receptors. Previous works from our laboratory demonstrate that some of these same chemokines/receptors have been shown to play central roles in chronic pain states. To uncover evidence of possible links between chronic morophine treatment chemokine signaling and analgesic tolerance we propose the hypothesis that opiate-induced chemokine signaling is central to analgesic tolerance. Our specific aims include 1) a characterization of the chronology of cellular/signaling events associated with opiate-induced hyperalgesia 2) explore mechanisms by which morphine induces chemokine/receptor expression in the dorsal root ganglia and 3) examine the cellular/molecular mechanisms by which chronic morphine treatment enhances chemokine signaling. Better understanding of these chemokine/receptor- mediated events may provide the necessary framework for the design of agents that counteract deleterious opiate-induced cellular adaptations and effectively reduce analgesic tolerance.

Screening brief intervention and referral to treatment has been effective in decreasing high risk behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use and unsafe sexual practices. The data on the effectiveness of brief interventions with opioid dependence is limited. This prospective randomized controlled trial of opioid dependent subjects (N=360) will compare two models of brief intervention with a control condition. ED patients with opioid dependence will be randomized to either: (1) Screening Brief Intervention with a Facilitated Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); (2) Screening Brief Intervention with ED initiated Buprenorphine Treatment (SBI+Bup); or (3) standard care (SC) which includes a handout detailing substance abuse treatment centers in the area. The primary outcome will be self-reported engagement in formal substance abuse treatment at 30 days verified by contact with the treatment program. Other outcomes measured at 30 days 2 6 and 12 months include changes in opioid use (self-report and urine toxicology analysis) HIV risk behaviors and health care service utilization. The three interventions will also be compared on their cost-effectiveness. We will test the hypotheses that SBI+Bup will be superior to SBIRT and SC and SBIRT will be superior to SC in (1) increasing the proportion of patients engaged in formal substance abuse treatment at 30 days; (2) reducing illicit opioid use; (3) reducing HIV risk behaviors; and (4) reducing health care service utilization. In addition we hypothesize that the societal costs of SBI+Bup per number of days of opioid abstinence will be cost effective relative to SBIRT or SC; and that SBIRT will be cost effective relative to SC. Data analyses will be conducted on the intention to treat sample of randomized patients. This study conducted by a research team with extensive experience evaluating brief interventions and treatments for opioid dependence will be unique in its: (1) comparison of two models of brief intervention with standard care; (2) inclusion of an ED initiated treatment arm; (3) use of manual-guided interventions with systematic assessment of adherence and competence; and (4) collection of detailed cost data to help guide future healthcare policy.

Specifically we seek to gain an understanding of the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in compulsive drug seeking. miRNAs are a family of small (~22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that can regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in target mRNA transcripts to facilitate their degradation and/or inhibit their translation. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs may play an important role in neuroplasticity but their role in addiction-related behavioral deficits is unknown. Specific Aim I will involve characterization of brain expression patterns of miRNAs in an animal model of compulsive cocaine consumption. Specifically we will examine the effects of restricted (1 h) or extended (6 h) daily access to intravenous cocaine self-administration in rats which results in a compulsive-like escalation of daily cocaine intake on the expression of miRNAs throughout cortical and subcortical brain regions heavily implicated in drug addiction neuropathology. In addition we will also assess miRNA expression patterns in the same brain regions in post-mortem brain tissues from human cocaine addicts. It is predicted that compulsive cocaine seeking in rats and humans will be associated with distinct patterns of dysregulated miRNA expression. Importantly convergent data between the rat and human tissues will provide support for the participation of particular miRNAs or families of miRNAs in addiction-related neuroplasticity. In Specific Aim II we will directly assess the relevance of the altered expression patterns of miRNAs that occur in rats compulsively seeking cocaine. Specifically we will infuse into discrete brain regions lentiviral vectors to over-express or locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified antagomiRs to knock-down targeted miRNAs. The effects of modulating targeted miRNAs in this manner will be assessed on compulsive cocaine seeking behavior in rats. Specific Aim III will involve functional characterization of miRNAs shown to modulate compulsive cocaine seeking. Here miRNAs whose expression modulates cocaine seeking will be studied with respect to cellular localization mechanism of regulation and identification of potential target mRNA transcripts upon which these miRNAs act. The proposed work promises to yield significant new insights into the pathophysiology of addiction and may reveal novel treatment and/or biomarker approaches for this devastating disorder.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Substance abuse disorders including cocaine addiction are a tremendous health burden to society.

Schratt et.al. (2006) have shown a link between miRNA function neuronal spine development and the action of at least one growth factor that may play a role in neuroplasticity. Yet little is known about miRNA expression patterns in the adult brain or whether changes in miRNA expression occur following either acute or repeated drug use or whether any miRNA might underlie any known messenger RNA (or protein) changes known to occur following drugs use (or abuse). We hypothesize that miRNA expression alterations will be distinct across various stages of substance abuse and that drug exposure will result in distinctive miRNA expression patterns (anatomical and/or temporal) in two distinct groups of rodents selectively-bred based upon the novelty seeking trait (High Responders (HR) vs Low Responders (LR)) as these two groups of rodents have unique patterns of gene expression basally after various types of challenges and display individual differences in the propensity for substance abuse. In Aim 1 we will use laser capture microscopy to isolate specific brain regions known to be direct targets of cocaine and/or undergo drug-induced changes in synaptic plasticity prior to broad-scale miRNA profiling. We will use tissues derived from both HR and LR rodents under basal conditions; conditions where gene expression differences exist. miRNA expression differences will be validated by miRNA qPCR and spatial patterns of expression analyzed by miRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) methods. In aim two we will use a cocaine sensitization paradigm (where drug exposure can be held constant) in both HR and LR rodents to examine miRNA regulation by cocaine at two time points (immediately following cocaine and following a period of abstinence) isolated and monitored as in aim 1. In aim 3 we will use cocaine self-administration procedures in HR and LR rodents collect tissues at two time points (acute and abstinence) to examine miRNA regulation. In Aim 4 we will use antagomirs to block basal or cocaine regulated HR/LR miRNA differences to determine if miRNA blockade alters drug-induced behaviors. Together these findings will shed light on whether miRNAs contribute to the initial propensity to seek drugs of abuse or play an important role in the induction and/or maintenance of cocaine addiction.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project evaluates small but novel genetic elements called microRNAs (miRNAs) that are thought to have broad influences on the types or amounts of proteins cells produce. In this proposal we plan to examine whether there are miRNA changes in two different rodent lines that vary in their propensity to seek drugs under basal conditions. Further we plan to examine in each rodent line how different miRNA levels vary in multiple brain regions as a function of cocaine use both acutely as well as long after the drug treatment has ceased. These findings will shed light on whether miRNAs contribute to the initial propensity to seek drugs of abuse or play an important role in the induction and/or maintenance of cocaine addiction.      ","368978",

It is anticipated that comprehensive mapping and study of epigenetic patterns both ""horizontally"" along the genomic sequence and ""vertically"" across multiple differentiation and developmental stages and physiological conditions will provide insights into human development physiology and disease. This vision of epigenomics calls both for novel organizational models suitable for high-throughput data-driven science and for innovative networked cyberinfrastructure. This project aims to develop such networked cyberinfrastructure and employ it to integrate and coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMCs) NCBI and other participants. The infrastructure builds on the now well established Genboree system which was developed in the context of numerous genome projects and has most recently been employed to coordinate the pilot stage of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. The infrastructure will provide both scalability for further integration of new epigenomic technologies with increasing data production throughputs and adaptability to accommodate an increasing diversity of experimental and computational methodologies. Using the software-as-a-service model web services and semantic web technologies the infrastructure will help integrate and coordinate efforts of REMCs NCBI and an increasing number of collaborating institutions and multi-disciplinary groups in the field of epigenomics working across geographic locations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epigenomics is the study of heritable or stable changes in human cells that are not coded in the genomic DNA. The role of epigenomic changes in diseases as diverse as obesity autism and cancer is coming to light. Importantly because epigenomic phenomena are affected by nutrition and environment including maternal nutrition during pregnancy increased understanding of epigenomics may lead to better health through changes in human nutrition and behavior. To better understand epigenomic phenomena in human health and disease the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics proposes comprehensive mapping and study of epigenomic patterns in human tissues at different developmental stages and physiological conditions. High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of such patterns. The amount and diversity of data produced will be very large and will require an informatic infrastructure for proper analysis. Building on the established Genboree system for collaborative genomic research over the Internet this project aims to develop such a networked infrastructure and employ it to integrate and to coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers and other participants in the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics.         ","1364573",

In pursuit of this goal we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology epigenomics technology production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information have high genome coverage require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection processing and analysis. For the REMC project we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells ES-derived cells mesenchymal stem cells reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.        ","3083250",

Sensitive diagnostic measures are necessary to identify patients with very early axonal injury who may be better candidates for intervention or even preventative therapy. The Cutaneous Measures of Diabetic Neuropathy (CMND) study extensively characterizes peripheral nerve function in 221 diabetic subjects with longitudinal follow-up. CMND shows that early diabetic neuropathy is characterized by progressive small fiber loss and identifies skin biopsy with intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) as a sensitive quantitative surrogate measure of neuropathy severity. IENFD closely correlates with clinical and electrodiagnostic measures of neuropathy and declines significantly over two years in diabetic subjects including those without neuropathy symptoms. We have shown that metabolic improvement achieved through individualized diet and exercise counseling for subjects with early neuropathy associated with impaired glucose tolerance significantly improves measures of small fiber neuropathy including pain and IENFD. We hypothesize that 1) early IENFD decline predicts future development of clinically meaningful diabetic neuropathy and 2) correction of IENFD decline with aggressive lifestyle intervention based on the impaired glucose tolerance neuropathy studies will successfully result in weight loss improved metabolic parameters and reduced risk of diabetic neuropathy development or slowing of its progression. Aim 1 will follow CMND diabetic subjects for an additional four years to determine the magnitude of early decline in IENFD that predicts future development of symptomatic distal polyneuropathy. Aim 2 will randomize 175 additional diabetic subjects without neuropathy symptoms to determine if two years of aggressive diet and exercise counseling reduces IENFD progression or incidence of symptomatic neuropathy. Both Aims will examine if metabolic syndrome obesity or specific baseline metabolic parameters insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or adipokine levels predict rate of IENFD decline or risk of future neuropathy development.

Elevated intracellular cAMP in the hepatocyte increases hepatic glucose production while the same signal in the pancreatic 2-cell promotes insulin secretion and proliferation. The cAMP signal activates protein kinase A (PKA) which phosphorylates the nuclear cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Phosphorylated CREB recruits the nuclear co-activators CREB binding protein (CBP) and the related protein p300. CBP but not p300 contains an insulin phosphorylation site at serine 436. Insulin phosphorylation at serine 436 is required for efficient dissociation of the CREB-CBP complex and consequent attenuation of CREB-dependent gene transcription. We have generated a knock-in mouse model where CBP is mutated at serine 436 (CBP-S436A) removing this site of insulin phosphorylation. As a result CREB-dependent gene transcription is increased and resistant to the inhibitory nuclear effects of insulin. These mice show enhanced hepatic glucose production and pancreatic 2-cell hyperplasia associated with a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These effects may be mediated by the PPAR3 co-activator 11(PGC-1 1 a cAMP target gene) whose expression is increased in both the hepatocyte and pancreatic 2-cell of these animals. PGC-11 activates a fasting gene program in liver and impairs energy production in the 2-cell. In this proposal we will attempt to understand if PGC-1 1 mediates the CBP S436A mouse phenotype since this mutation may affect other signaling pathways (Aim 1). CBP and p300 may have discrete physiological roles based on the presence or absence respectively of an insulin phosphorylation site. Aim 2 will establish the relative importance and mechanism of hepatic and 2-cell regulation mediated by these closely related co- activators by studying a mouse model where an artificial insulin phosphorylation site is introduced in p300 (G421S). Finally CBP remains in the nucleus regardless of its phosphorylation state while the forkhead protein FoxO1 is excluded from the nucleus after insulin phosphorylation. FoxO1 has been reported to play a dominant role in activating hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibiting 2-cell growth based on over-expression mouse models. Aim 3 will compare the effects of insulin phosphorylation mutants of CBP and FoxO1 expressed at allelic levels on hepatic glucose production and 2-cell regulation and/or growth. These studies are significant because they will establish signaling pathways that normally regulate the hepatocyte and pancreatic 2-cell in vivo and provide a mechanistic understanding of pathophysiological changes found in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Mutations scattered along Lmna which encodes A-type lamins are associated to a broad range of human diseases collectively called laminopathies. The molecular etiology of these diseases remains unknown. In mammalian cells the recent characterization of the LINC complex an evolutionary-conserved protein complex that spans the nuclear envelope and physically connects the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton of mammalian cells suggest that nucleus is intimately tethered to the cytoskeleton. Based on our preliminary results and from data available from lower organisms we hypothesize that the deleterious effect of Lmna mutations consist in the severe disruption of physical connections that mediate essential physiological cellular processes such as nuclear dynamics cellular mechanical stiffness and polarization. Three specific aims will be developed in this project: 1) Using live-cell microscopy and a flow-based assay the rates of translocation of both the nucleus and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) as well as the MTOC/nucleus distance in real time and in 3D will be compared in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking A-type lamins (derived from a mouse model of human muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy) and their wild-type counterparts. Using quantitative imaging we also will determine whether A-type lamin deficiency affects key cytoskeleton-based cell functions including single-cell motility and MTOC polarization. 2) Based on the hypothesis that the LINC complex mediates several physiological processes controlled by A-type lamins the contribution of the whole LINC complex as well as of its respective components to cellular mechanical stiffness and cytoskeleton-based cell functions will also be investigated. 3) The effect of disease-associated mutations of Lmna on the LINC complex integrity and cytoskeleton functions will be examined in mouse fibroblasts and myoblasts. We anticipate that this project will shed light on the biophysical principles that govern nucleus dynamics and nucleus-cytoskeleton connections and will identify key molecular linkers that regulate this interconnection and play a critical role in cellular mechanical stiffness polarization and motility. Results from experiments using our quantitative assays may also help establish a biophysical basis for the wide variety of disease phenotypes associated to human laminopathies. Public Health Relevance: Mutations scattered along the Lmna gene which encodes A-type lamins are associated to a broad range of human diseases collectively called laminopathies. The proposed research drawing from bioengineering and cell biology may help establish a biophysical basis for the wide variety of disease phenotypes associated to human laminopathies.      ","368478",

In this application we request funding to conduct a genome-wide association study of migraine and migraine traits within a large prospective cohort of more than 27000 women of whom more than 5000 reported migraine. DNA from blood samples of all participants is presently undergoing a whole genome scan using the Illumina platform. In addition extensive plasma-based phenotyping has been performed. Approximately 20 percent of the population suffers from migraine headaches; however at any age women are affected 3 to 4 times more often than men. Migraines account for most pain-related emergency room visits and may persist as a chronic condition throughout the lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of migraine and a long history of relevant research many questions remain regarding the pathophysiology and the multitude of endogenous and exogenous factors that influence this complex disorder. Gene mutations for rare forms of migraine have been recently identified. While linkage analyses have identified chromosomal loci in common forms of migraine the underlying genes are unknown. In addition candidate gene approaches in common forms of migraine have been disappointing mainly due to lack of replication and small samples sizes. Thus the genetic causes for common forms of migraine remain elusive. We propose 1) to identify novel candidate genetic variants/genes of migraine using (i) a conventional genome-wide association approach and (ii) a novel weighted genome-wide association approach that utilizes information from previously proposed chromosomal loci and 2) to explore interactions between identified candidate genetic variants/genes of migraine with biomarkers and environmental factors. We further propose two secondary aims in which we extend the evaluation of our primary aims to migraine traits in particular migraine aura status. To achieve these aims we propose to utilize information from the Women's Health Study (WHS) a large well-characterized cohort of women 45 years of age and older in 1993. DNA has been extracted from collected blood samples from 27939 women and a whole genome scan of all available DNA samples is underway and expected to be completed by December 2008. At baseline and during follow-up over 5000 women reported migraine. In contrast to other large cohorts of US women the WHS is an extraordinary resource that not only has extensive data on many traditional epidemiologic exposures but also detailed information about migraine. Furthermore plasma-based phenotyping is available on an exceptionally large number of samples. Thus the WHS is particularly suited to study the genomics of migraine as well as gene-gene gene-biomarker and gene-environment interactions in a very cost-effective way. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Migraine is a very common headache disorder that particularly affects women.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD) these cells bind -amyloid (A) and accumulate at sites of A deposition including senile plaques. Microglial interactions with A promote a chronic inflammatory response characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and complement proteins. This sterile inflammation is maintained by persistent microglial activation by A and leads to neuronal degeneration and increased A deposition and therefore promotes disease progression. The receptors that bind A and the signaling pathways triggered by A that promote chronic inflammation are not fully understood. Our long-term goals are to identify the molecular mechanisms of microglial activation by A and the impact of these pathways on AD pathogenesis. We hypothesize that Toll-like receptors (TLR) an evolutionarily ancient family of pattern recognition receptors that detect microbial ligands initiate and maintain the microglial inflammatory response to A. This hypothesis is based on preliminary findings that targeted deletion of the TLR signaling adaptor MyD88 abrogates microglial inflammatory responses to A in vitro and in vivo. In this proposal we will define the TLRs and co-receptors responsible for initiating this signaling their impact on microglial inflammatory responses and the implications for disease. Specifically we will (1) Define the role of TLR ligation and signaling on microglial responses to A in vitro (2) Determine the role of A co-receptors in facilitating TLR signaling and (3) Determine the impact of A-TLR signaling on Alzheimer's disease pathology in vivo. Understanding the mechanism(s) of microglial interactions with A and identifying the receptors involved in these interactions will provide valuable insight into the role of these cells in the pathogenesis of AD and potentially identify therapeutic targets in AD to promote microglial clearance of A while downregulating their neurotoxic effects.

Asian Americans have the highest prevalence of chronic HBV approximately 10% to 15% followed by other groups including men who have sex with men injection drug users and hemodialysis patients (3% to 5% each). Risk factors for liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBV patients remain undefined though recent data support virological markers (HBV DMA quantitation) as important. Many questions still remain regarding true factors predictive of disease progression (Significance of intrahepatic cccDNA?) and optimal antiviral treatment strategies defining duration of therapy while minimizing resistance. The objectives and aims of this 7-year study are: 1) to design a database to document HBV natural history help identify risk factors for disease progression and establish a well-characterized repository of serum samples and liver tissue for ongoing and future studies; 2) to design a long-term clinical trial to study the resistance profile efficacy durability of response and tolerability of different combinations of nucleos(t)ide analog drugs; and 3) to measure intrahepatic cccDNA decline on the nucleos(t)ide drug combinations. For the database protocol eAg (+) and eAg (-) chronic HBV patients will be prospectively enrolled into a long-term observational database. Patients will continue to be followed by the investigators per standard-of-care and have demographic data clinical data serum/tissue samples and outcomes data collected at regular time points over the study duration. Antiviral treatment is at the discretion of the individual investigator. The resulting large repository of data and specimen samples will serve as an important resource for future studies. For the clinical trial study eAg (+) and eAg (-) chronic HBV patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either tenofovir monotherapy entecavir monotherapy or tenofovir + entecavir combination therapy for 240 weeks then observed for relapse. Analyses of phenotypic/genotypic resistance development rates of eAg seroconversion HBV DNA undetectability relapse after therapy and tolerability will allow comparison of these endpoints between the three treatment strategies.   End-of-treatment (Week 240) liver biopsies will allow determination of intrahepatic cccDNA decline for the three treatment strategies when compared to baseline liver biopsies. Information gained from this study will help determine the optimal treatment to prevent resistance + the optimal duration of therapy to achieve durable responses.      ","144242",

With the availability of effective and well-tolerated HBV treatments reductions in liver-related deaths are achievable but unanswered questions regarding treatment include whether the current target groups for treatment should be expanded if combinations of drugs are superior to single drug therapy and what treatment endpoints should be used. In conjunction with the other HBV Clinical Trial Network investigators the San Francisco HBV Consortium a collaborative group of San Francisco investigators at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center California Pacific Medical Center and UCSF/San Francisco General Hospital with access to >6000 persons with chronic HBV infection will address key issues in the natural history pathogenesis and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). With other HBV CRN investigators we will establish an informational database of ~3000 persons with CHB for cross-sectional and cohort studies linked with a serum and tissue repository for clinical/translational studies. Our study aims for the database focus on (i) immune-tolerant CHB and the viral genetic and host predictors of ""lost tolerance""; and (iii) the risk of perinatal transmission in HBsAg-positive women. Each of these special populations is a potential target group for therapeutic studies within the Network. Additionally we will also execute 2 clinical trials with the primary goal of comparing combination versus monotherapy as first-line therapy for HBeAg-positive CHB and HBeAg-negative CHB. Combination therapy may offer greater antiviral potency and lower risk of drug resistance but has added cost and may lower adherence. A clinical adaptive design is used. For HBeAg-negative CHB we will compare entecavir (ETV) plus tenofovir (TDV) to tenofovir (TDV) and entecavir (ETV) monotherapies for a prolonged but finite treatment period of 48 months. For HBeAg-positive CHB we will compare TDV monotherapy for48 months versus sequential TDV (for 3 month lead-in)/peginterferon (peg-IFN) alfa 2a for 6months/TDV for 39 months versus combination TDV plus ETV for 48 months. Patients with primary non-response or suboptimal virologic response at 6 and 24 months respectively will be discontinued from treatment. HBeAg-positive CHB patients achieving HBeAg seroconversion will undergo randomized to 6 versus 24 months of consolidation TDV therapy. Host genetic (including transporter polymorphisms) and virologic (HBsAg quantitation cccDNA) will be examined as predictors of response/non-response.    ","149154",

Complications of CHB including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) result in 1.2 million deaths per year making CHB the 10th leading cause of mortality worldwide. The natural history of CHB is complex and variable. Many viral and host factors have been implicated in disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis but most of these conclusions have been based on retrospective analyses with limited longitudinal data. Currently six agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of CHB. Each of these agents given as monotherapy has been shown to produce virological biochemical and histological benefits for both HBeAg positive and negative CHB. However each are associated with limitations. The significant side-effect profile of interferon for example limits its long-term use. The approved oral agents are tolerable even with prolonged use but drug resistance has been identified with each of them. To date the limited data on combination therapy with nucleoside analogue and pegylated interferon (PEGIFN) or two nucleos(t)ide analogues given for one year does not show their superiority in durability of response compared to monotherapy. However there have been no studies to address the efficacy of prolonged combination therapy. In this proposal by working collaboratively with the 10 clinical centers the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) Virology Center and Immunology Center within the NIH HBV network we plan to (1)construct a prospective comprehensive patient database that includes demographic and clinical features viral factors liver histology and radiological findings that will enable us to examine the natural history of hepatitis B and to identify predictors of disease progression and recovery using both cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical data; and (2) design a 3-year phase III prospective multicenter randomized open-label study to compare the efficacy and safety of entecavir (ETV) versus ETV and tenofovir (TDF) versus ETV and PEGIFN-alpha-2a for treatment naive patients with HBeAg positive and negative CHB. Patients randomized to the third arm will receive a 2-year course of PEGIFN and a 3-year course of ETV. ETV and TDF are structurally distinct potent antiviral agents that do not have cross-resistance. We hypothesize that(1) both combination therapy arms will have higher rates of HBV DNA suppression and lower rates of resistance compared to ETV monotherapy; and (2) the combination of PEGIFN with ETV will produce the highest rates of both HBeAg and HBsAg seroconversion and hence durability of response. Collectively the database and trial will yield rich data regarding natural history and optimal therapy for CHB.    ","129767",

A major goal of interventions designed to eliminate drug seeking therefore must be to eliminate the ability of contextual cues to elicit memories that result in relapse. Behavioral and neurobiological approaches to memory have identified extinction in which the relation between the context and the drug is severed as a way to eliminate conditioned behavior. A major challenge for extinction-based therapies however is that extinguished behavior often returns with time or after re-exposure to the drug. Thus extinction-based behavioral interventions must focus on ways to enhance the development of extinction as well as methods to make the extinction memory long- lasting causing persistent suppression of the original context-drug association. At a molecular level studies of memory and extinction have demonstrated the necessity of gene transcription for long-term memory storage. Our research has found that regulation of gene transcription necessary for long-term memory formation involves the concerted action of multiple transcription factors and cofactors that interact with chromatin a protein complex that packages DNA. Chromatin modification is a main mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation which is emerging as a major molecular pathway involved in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression required for synaptic plasticity and memory storage. Epigenetic gene regulation has been shown to underlie persistent long-term changes at the cellular level as well as the behavioral level. Importantly in animal models of addiction chronic drug exposure induces stable chromatin modification resulting in maintained gene expression which is thought to drive persistent changes in behavior. Considering the substantial overlap in the circuitry involved in drug addiction and learning and memory pathways the focus of this grant application is to modulate learning and memory pathways in order to extinguish context-drug associated memories. We will use a combined behavioral pharmacological and genetic strategy to examine ways to enhance the development of extinction of cocaine-induced conditioned place preferences to cause persistent suppression of the original context-drug association. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the best temporal pattern of context presentations to extinguish context-cocaine associations using the conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure. In Specific Aim 2 we will examine the behavioral and molecular consequences of administration of systemic or intra-hippocampal drugs that relax chromatin structure thereby enhancing gene transcription during extinction of cocaine-induced CPP. In Specific Aim 3 we will examine the effects of inhibiting a chromatin modifying enzyme called CREB-binding protein (CBP) which relaxes chromatin structure through genetic mutations and focal deletions of CBP thereby inhibiting transcription during extinction of cocaine-induced CPP. This novel approach promises to elucidate behavioral and epigenetic mechanisms of extinction and will allow us to identify further molecular targets and brain systems for pharmacological interventions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cocaine addiction is a major public health problem in the United States. In this project we examine behavioral and pharmacological interventions in a mouse model of cocaine seeking that may help reverse cocaine seeking and reduce relapse.      ","400479",

Such studies have historically been rate-limited by the cost of DNA sequencing. Although a new generation of sequencing platforms is reducing costs by over two orders of magnitude the routine sequencing of complete human genomes continues to be prohibitively expensive. Recently methods have been developed to enable the efficient capture of specific subsets of the genome. With these methods the cost of sequencing all of the protein-coding sequences (i.e. ~1% of the human genome split across ~180000 discontiguous subsequences) may soon be on par with that of dense genotyping arrays. The goals of this proposal are to further the development of these targeting methods and to integrate them into a scalable resequencing pipeline that relies on second-generation sequencing technology. Specifically we will: (1) optimize and evaluate candidate strategies for multiplex capture including array hybridization and gap-fill molecular inversion probes while extending their application to the full protein-coding genome; (2) integrate optimized capture methods second-generation sequencing technology and sequence analysis software into a scalable resequencing pipeline; (3) develop the requisite computational tools for translating raw sequence data generated by new sequencing platforms into quality-tagged consensus predictions of sequence variants; (4) make our data and methods broadly available and facilitate the goals of this program through open communication with other investigators and the NIH.

The predominant etiologies of TBI in young children are motor vehicle accidents firearm incidents falls and child abuse. Unfortunately falls are the leading cause of non-inflicted head injury in infants less than a year old and are also the most common history provided by caretakers suspected of child abuse. Some cases are easy to diagnose but in cases of uncertainty accurate diagnosis of inflicted trauma is hindered by a lack of clarity regarding specific head injury mechanisms for young infants. The objective of this research proposal is to provide clinicians with a biomechanics-based tool to aide in the diagnosis of inflicted or non-inflicted trauma with a history of a low- height fall. In Aim 1 biomechanical tolerances of extra-axial hemorrhage (subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage) are determined by using a porcine computational model to simulate non-impact rapid head rotation experiments in 3-5 day old piglets. Mechanical responses from the model (cortical displacement relative to skull and peak cortical tissue strain) are statistically correlated with the actual occurrence of extra- axial hemorrhage (EAH) on the piglets' cortex to identify biomechanical tolerances associated with 10 50 and 90 percent probability of EAH. To validate this tolerance and determine probability thresholds with the greatest specificity and sensitivity to predicting EAH in cases of well-witnessed falls a human infant computational model is developed in Aim 2 to predict the brain and skull response to impact. Simulating well-witnessed cases of falls in infants the biomechanical tolerance for EAH in Aim 1 and a biomechanical tolerance for skull fracture previously published from our lab are used to determine the probability of skull fracture and EAH most predictive of the injuries in each of the case simulations. To measure loads in common household fall settings a 1 1/2 month old human infant biofidelic surrogate is used in Aim 3 to recreate falls from 1 2 and 3 feet onto carpet concrete hardwood tile and linoleum to simulate common household fall settings. Impact force and angular accelerations for ten repetitions of each height surface and primary head impact location (parietal or occipital) are obtained creating a load corridor for each fall scenario. Combining the biomechanical loads from the surrogate experiments existing pediatric large animal TBI data and a new biofidelic computational model of the brain and skull of a human infant a predictive tool to is created in Aim 4 to determine the plausibility of skull fracture and extra-axial hemorrhages (EAH) in infants following low height falls. Validated with real-word clinical data this biomechanical data will advance the understanding of injury thresholds in common non- inflicted scenarios that will ultimately improve the accuracy in detection of inflicted and non-inflicted head trauma. National objectives from Healthy People 2010 calls for a reduction in child maltreatment a reduction in fatalities caused by child maltreatment a reduction in unintentional injury and a reduction in deaths from falls. Developing a clinical tool that is biomechanically sound and informs clinical practice will directly contribute to the fulfillment of these national health and welfare priorities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposed research plan will advance the understanding of injury thresholds in common non-inflicted scenarios that will ultimately improve the accuracy in detection of inflicted and non-inflicted head trauma.

The specific roles of microbes in these symbiotic relationships have been best elucidated for that subset of microbes grown in pure culture. However the application of cultivation-independent molecular surveys reveals that many of these microbes have yet to be cultivated. We propose to cultivate a physiological subset of novel microbes from the human microbiome - the microaerobes - by incorporating unique approaches to isolation and cultivation. We are focusing on microaerobes because oxygen diffusing into the GI tract from host tissue creates a microoxic zone adjacent to the tissue that is likely to be colonized by microaerobes. As a result of the proximity to the host tissue these microbes are likely to interact directly with the host and so are key to understanding the role of the microbiome in human health and disease. Microbes are typically isolated under an atmosphere of 21% oxygen or strictly anoxic conditions. While these conditions are suitable for the cultivation of many organisms microaerobes thrive under reduced concentrations of oxygen. They have specialized respiratory enzymes to harvest oxygen at low concentrations and as a result occupy niches not available to typical aerobes. Microaerobes including populations of Helicobacter and Campylobacter occupy the GI tracts of many animals. We propose to extend the availability of cultured microaerobes from the human microbiome as follows: 1) Exploit microoxic atmospheres and novel cultivation strategies to isolate microaerobes from the mucosa of the human GI tract 2) Select representative microaerobes based on their distribution and abundance in the GI tract and their estimated prevalence in the human population 3) Provide a physiological characterization of representative isolates that are sent for genome sequencing. Pure cultures of microaerophiles will not only enable direct sequencing of their genomes but will be a valuable resource for genetic biochemical and physiological experiments to test hypotheses generated from genome analyses. An improved understanding of the physiological ecology of these microbes and their impact on humans is most accessible when they are studied in pure and defined mixed cultures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex communities of microbes are intimately associated with the human body. To better understand their role in human health and disease we proposed to cultivate these microbes in the laboratory to facilitate studies that will include the sequencing of their genomes.      ","468778",

To date analysis of ethical and social considerations in the use of probiotics have focused on ""over the counter"" applications where physician involvement in the selection and administration of the probiotic is limited. As new probiotic therapies become a part of the clinician's arsenel it is important to consider how patients may perceive and respond to new probiotic therapies that are recommended by their physicians. To be successfully integrated into patient care it is critical that patient attitudes and beliefs regarding bioengineered probiotics be well characterized. Studies of patient perceptions of therapeutic probiotics may reveal common misconceptions about probiotic therapies and/or widespead concerns that may limit patient enthusiasm for new therapeutic options. This research project will characterize patient perceptions of bioengineered probiotics and other potential clinical applications of metagenomic analyses of the human microbiome. Empirical results from the project will be presented to a Working Group of national experts in gastroenterology biomedical ethics health policy and patient advocacy who will identify opportunities to promote the responsible introduction of bioengineered probiotics into the care of patients with debilitating gastrointestinal diseases. These strategies will focus on potential health-policy initiatives and educational interventions that gastroenterologists patient educators and voluntary-health organizations can undertake now in anticipation of the time when bioengineered probiotic therapies may be appropriate for routine clinical use.

To date analysis of ethical and social considerations in the use of probiotics have focused on ""over the counter"" applications where physician involvement in the selection and administration of the probiotic is limited. As new probiotic therapies become a part of the clinician's arsenel it is important to consider how patients may perceive and respond to new probiotic therapies that are recommended by their physicians. To be successfully integrated into patient care it is critical that patient attitudes and beliefs regarding bioengineered probiotics be well characterized. Studies of patient perceptions of therapeutic probiotics may reveal common misconceptions about probiotic therapies and/or widespead concerns that may limit patient enthusiasm for new therapeutic options. This research project will characterize patient perceptions of bioengineered probiotics and other potential clinical applications of metagenomic analyses of the human microbiome. Empirical results from the project will be presented to a Working Group of national experts in gastroenterology biomedical ethics health policy and patient advocacy who will identify opportunities to promote the responsible introduction of bioengineered probiotics into the care of patients with debilitating gastrointestinal diseases. These strategies will focus on potential health-policy initiatives and educational interventions that gastroenterologists patient educators and voluntary-health organizations can undertake now in anticipation of the time when bioengineered probiotic therapies may be appropriate for routine clinical use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This research study will examine patient perceptions of bioengineered probiotics and other potential clinical applications of metagenomic analyses of the human microbiome. Systematic data on patient attitudes and beliefs about emerging therapeutic interventions facilitated by the Human Microbiome Project are critically important as these data can identify potential barriers to the successful integration of bioengineered probiotics into patient care and improve physician-patient communication about new therapeutic options.      ","200000",

Here we propose the development of an efficient and scalable method to obtain genome sequences from single microbial cells. This will eliminate the need to obtain pure laboratory culture thus allow us to systematically characterize the genome structure of microbial communities that resides in different parts of the human body. The proposed project contains three major components. 1. Development of low-cost and disposable cell sorting devices that integrate microfluidics with micro- scale optical components. Such a lab-on-chip cell sorter will be able to identify and isolate single microbial cells from samples that contain hundreds to thousands of different species and often are contaminated with free DNAs from the host and other sources. 2. Development of a micro-well based polymerase cloning device for simultaneous amplification of genomes from hundreds to thousands of single microbial cells in parallel. Using such a device we will prepare sufficient amount of DNAs from single cells for whole genome shotgun sequencing a critical step to obtain genome sequences from single cells. 3. Development of an integrate pipeline for dissecting the genome composition of human microbiome at the single cell resolution. We will test this pipeline by isolating and sequencing genome from approximately 35 single microbial cells at different levels of relative abundance from the mouse distal intestine.

Epigenetic regulation is a fundamental mechanism that involves not only in normal developmental processes but also in many human diseases. Epigenetic regulation can take place in the methylation of DNA covalent modifications of histone or interactions between nucleosome and DNA. DNA methylation is the most stable form of epigenetic modification that leads to transcriptional silencing X chromosome inactivation and imprinting. Obtaining genome-scale patterns of DNA methylation in different normal and disease tissues are critical for understanding the developmental processes as well as the etiology of many human diseases However in contrast to rapid advances in human genome sequencing it is still impractical to characterize the methylation status of every single CpG in the human genome at a reasonable cost. The goal of this proposal is to enable digital quantification of DNA methylation status of non-repetitive CpG islands on the genome scale efficiently and inexpensively. We plan to achieve this goal by developing two complementary methods that can specifically extract all non-repetitive CpG islands (or any subset) from the bisulfite converted genome and coupling these target selection methods with next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. This will lead to a significant reduction (~100-fold) in the cost of sequencing as the size of the sequencing target is reduced from the full human genome to all non-repetitive CpG islands of ~20Mbps in total length. In addition since all CpG islands will be captured and sequenced as a pool through a series of single-tube reactions our methods do not require robotic devices for complicated liquid handling. The simplicity and scalability of our methods will enable true genome-scale analysis of DNA methylation patterns in a large number of biological samples. Recognizing the rapid evolution of DNA sequencing technology we will also optimize the target selection front-ends to be widely adaptable to different DNA sequencing platforms such that the throughput and cost will scale linearly in the future. The specific aims are as follows: 1) Single molecule bisulfite sequencing of all non-repetitive CpG islands in the human genome using padlock probes; 2) array-based capture of CpG islands for shotgun bisulfite sequencing of all non-repetitive CpG islands in the human genome; 3)characterization of global DNA methylation changes in the differentiation of stem cells; 4) develop computational infractructure and methods that will enable users to easily acquire evaluate and visualize the next-generation DNA sequencing data and will help optimize the bisulfite sequencing technology development. The proposed genome-scale bisulfite sequencing approach will represent significant improvements over existing epigenomic profiling technologies in both the scale (>80% CpG islands in the genome) and the resolution (single CpG single molecule) of analyses. It will accelerate the studies of global DNA methylation patterns in various tissues at different developmental stages. It will also provide digital profiles of aberrant DNA methylation in many human diseases and offer a robust method for classifying disease subtypes.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epigenetic processes modulate the packaging and function of the human genome in normal developmental processes and many pathologic states including human cancers.

Key to the establishment of these regions is the presence of specific histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) on chromatin. These epigenetic marks provide signals that recruit proteins to activate or repress transcription. The precise marking of a given histone (or particular combination of markings) is key for driving the cellular program of gene expression. The mis-regulation of histone PTM addition or removal has been linked to diseases such as cancer. Current technologies used to study histone PTMs are largely limited by the analysis of a single histone PTM in context of chromosomal location while it appears that the combinatorial nature of histone PTM addition is key for transcriptional regulation. We outline the development of a novel technology that will enable epigeneticists to isolate a given region of a chromosome (on the order of 5 nucleosomes) identify the contained and co-occupancy of histone PTMs identify the proteome component of the particular region of chromatin and control for non-specifically interacting proteins/PTMs. This procedure will be referred to as ChAP-MS for chromatin affinity purification with mass spectrometry. The working hypothesis of our proposed work is: development of the ChAP-MS technology to specifically enrich small chromosome fragments for mass spectrometric analysis will enable epigeneticists to perform whole epigenome and chromosome proteome studies for the first time. Our objectives are 1) Development of a chromatin affinity purification (ChAP) technology that will permit efficient isolation of specific chromosomal fragments for use in epigenomic and proteomic profiling 2) Devise an unambiguous readout strategy to be used in conjunction with ChAP analysis that permits discrimination between specific and non-specific protein/histone interactions with a defined chromosomal fragment 3) Design microscale protocols to be used in conjunction with ChAP analysis for separating each core histone component of a given chromosomal fragment on the basis of PTM occupancy thus allowing mass spectrometric profiling of histone PTMs and 4) Use ChAP-MS to profile the epigenome and proteome of a histone acetyltransferase complex.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding how histones are post-translationally modified will enable researchers to better understand the molecular mechanism of diseases such as cancer.

While many transcription factors co-regulators and histone modifications exist in interphase chromatin and are important for gene regulation those which occur in mitotic chromatin can clearly confer non-mutational epigenetic inheritance. Histone modifications are broadly associated with active or inactive genes but do not set or re-set precise gene expression states. Such states can be set by transcription factors and co-regulators but most which have been investigated do not occupy mitotic chromatin and hence cannot be epigenetic. However we recently discovered that FoxA transcription factors which possess intrinsic chromatin opening properties and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which loosens local chromatin along with poly(ADP ribose) (pADPr) itself are distinct from many other factors in that they stably occupy mitotic chromatin. Furthermore we discovered that FoxA factors and PARP interact with one another and have many genetic targets in common. Our recent mechanistic studies using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) show that FoxA and PARP binding to chromatin is far more stable than that of most other transcription factors. Also we developed an assay to monitor nascent chromatin sites modified by PARP. Given the ability of these factors to remain stably bound to chromatin through mitosis and their ability to establish a transcriptionally competent state we propose that FoxA PARP and pADPr are a new class of epigenetic mark. We propose the following aims to investigate these epigenetic marks in mitosis: 1. To determine genomic sites of FoxA and PARP1 occupancy and polyADP ribosylation which are specific to mitotic chromatin compared to interphase chromatin. Such sites would represent a distinctive subset of regulatory sequences for epigenetic inheritance. Such sites will be identified by genomic ChIP approaches and tested for regulatory function. Motif analysis of flanking sequences and TAP-tag studies in mitotic cells will reveal cooperating factors which act at mitotic epigenetic control elements. 2. To determine how FoxA PARP1 and polyADP ribosylation stably persist in mitotic chromatin and affect local chromatin structure. FRAP studies of FoxA and PARP1 and mutants thereof and of FoxA and PARP1 partners in mitotic chromatin will be performed to understand how these epigenetic factors remain engaged in mitosis under the extraordinary degree of mitotic chromosome compaction. We will investigate whether FoxA or PARP occupancy or polyADP ribosylation may induce special structural configurations at epigenetic marks in mitotic chromatin.       ","736520",

ALS is an inexorably progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no effective therapy.  Familial ALS due to specific mutations in the SOD1 gene (e.g. A4V) is a very rapidly progressive form of the disease that is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of SOD1-containing aggregates within both neurons and astrocytes.  Mutant SOD1 reduces the activity of heat shock proteins and thereby permits the formation of protein aggregates that constitute these neuronal and astrocytic inclusions.  Arimoclomol a co-inducer of heat shock protein gene expression promotes de novo protein folding facilitates repair of misfolded proteins and targets misfolded proteins for degradation.  In addition to its targeting a pathogenic mechanism in SOD1 positive familial ALS arimoclomol significantly prolongs survival in the SOD1 mouse model of ALS even when administered after the appearance of clinically manifest disease.  Furthermore arimoclomol has proven safe and tolerable in a Phase 2a study of patients with sporadic ALS it crosses the blood-brain barrier and exhibits a dose-dependent increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration.  This seamless adaptive Phase 2/3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial will enroll approximately 80 participants in two stages.  The first stage will include 30 participants followed monthly over a period of 6 months.  Results of this first stage will be used to determine safety tolerability futility and potential efficacy of arimoclomol.  The analysis of this stage-1 data will also be used to re-estimate the sample size required for the second stage of the study that will include approximately an additional 50 subjects followed over a period of 12 months.  Participants in stage-1 will continue to be followed for an additional 6 months in stage-2.  The primary outcome measure is the change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) between baseline and the month-12 visit.  Secondary outcome measures include time to tracheostomy or permanent assisted ventilation forced vital capacity negative inspiratory force strength long-term safety and tolerability of arimoclomol as well as motor unit number estimates.      ","347273",

Thus Ultrasound molecular imaging has the potential to have a widespread impact in clinical medicine and biological research. Current non-contrast-assisted ultrasound lacks the specificity to detect molecular signatures of targeted disease events such as angiogenesis. However ultrasound has the advantages of low cost portability and dynamic imaging capability and is already widely used for clinical diagnosis. Targeted contrast agents have been developed for ultrasound molecular imaging but their immunogenic properties make them untranslatable to the clinic. Thus improving the safety and enhancing the sensitivity of ultrasound molecular imaging will have a significant impact on the diagnosis and assessment of thrombus inflammation and cancer. Before ultrasound molecular imaging can be translated to the clinic the immunogenic effects caused by the exposure of targeting ligands on the contrast agent surface must be reduced. We propose research studies to examine in detail the physicochemical mechanisms of immune response to ultrasound contrast agents and we will use this data to design contrast agents which are shielded from this immune response. Simultaneously we will study the ultrasound interaction with stealth agents that have been shown in preliminary data to be selectively activated by ultrasound radiation force. Collaboration with an ultrasound device manufacturer will allow the modification of a small-animal imaging system for specific optimization to work with the new stealth contrast agents for enhanced pre-clinical imaging. The end goal will be to develop safer ultrasound contrast agents which will also exhibit increased specificity and circulation time in-vivo and to improve ultrasound scanner technology to take advantage of new stealth contrast agents.

Despite its prevalence however macroautophagy is still poorly understood making it difficult to define how it contributes towards pathogenesis. Perhaps unsurprisingly in different disorders macroautophagy has been considered both as a potentially causative and potentially ameliorative element in disease progression. If we are to target this complex degradative pathway for therapeutics we need to better define the autophagic process in a means we can apply it towards the brain. In this grant submission we propose to gain new insights into macroautophagy by focusing on the key organelle involved:  the autophagic vacuole (AV). Defined as an onion-like multilamellar vesicle that is positive for the marker MAP1LC3 (a mammalian homologue of ATG8) the formation and maturation of this structure is at the heart of the autophagic process and is by far the least understood. Using a novel approach which we have developed that can isolate specific populations of AV for proteomic and lipid-based analyses we will:  1) characterize AVs from neuronal cells and brain; 2) compare and contrast MAP1LC3- labeled AVs from vesicles labeled with the other four ATG8 mammalian homologues; and 3) use functional cell based assays to further define how the various ATG8- proteomes impact macroautophagy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Macroautophagy is a poorly understood process that is important for allowing cells such as neurons to get rid of proteins that no longer function. Interestingly this process has been implicated to be at the heart of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease many lysosomal storage diseases and others. Here we propose to study macroautophagy as it pertains to the brain so that we can use this information to design effective treatment for these many diseases.    ","352188",

We propose to employ multi-stage mass-spectrometry (MSn) for de novo sequencing of NRPs including cyclic NRPs. Analysis of MSn spectra of a cyclic peptide results in the difficult combinatorial problem of interpreting multiple linear peptides from the same spectrum. This proposal develops new combinatorial algorithms for solving this issue. Since the MSn based mass spectrometry analysis of NPRs is fast and inexpensive and requires minimal amounts of material (<1 5g) this approach opens a possibility of high-throughput sequencing of many unknown NRPs accumulated in large bioactivity marine cyanobacterial screening programs. In parallel to the automation of the NRPs sequencing efforts we will harvest a set of orphan gene clusters from marine actinomycetes to generate a library of cyclic peptides. The algorithms developed in this proposal will be used to fully characterize this cyclic imine library. This work not only sets the stage for the automated characterization of NRPs but will also be applicable to the characterization of other peptidic natural products such as peptaibols peptide derived toxins or lantibiotics.

Chronic wounds including diabetic leg and pressure ulcers impose a significant health care burden worldwide. Currently chronic wound therapy is primarily supportive. Novel treatments that effectively stimulate specific wound healing pathways would greatly reduce healthcare and economic costs lessen the chance of amputation and improve the quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a complex array of cell adhesion sites cell migration pathways and proliferation signals to cells and imparts mechanical stability to the healing wound. Mechanical forces influence the deposition organization and structure of ECM fibronectin fibrils which in turn affects cell function ECM organization and stability tissue tensile strength and vascular perfusion. Ultrasound (US) is currently used clinically to promote bone healing and has been shown to enhance soft tissue repair. Certain biological effects of US are known to occur through non-thermal mechanical mechanisms. Thus we hypothesize that mechanical forces associated with US propagation are capable of remodeling fibronectin in chronic wounds to expose biologically active sites that in turn enhance myofibroblast growth and contractility stimulate epithelial cell migration promote collagen organization and mechanical strength and increase blood flow to tissues. In this proposal we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of scientists engineers and clinicians with expertise in cell and ECM biology biomedical ultrasound and acoustics vascular biology and wound healing. We will use noninvasive US fields to identify key biological and physical mechanisms for US-enhanced soft tissue wound healing in order to develop the use of US for chronic wound therapy. Knowledge of basic mechanisms provides the power to design optimized exposure parameters identify synergistic therapies and engineer exposure systems that maximize the therapeutic effects of US while minimizing adverse side effects.    Public Health Relevance Statement (provided by applicant): Chronic wounds including diabetic leg and pressure ulcers impose a significant health care burden worldwide.

It is part of a larger group of chronic functional pain disorders which also include such common disorders as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and fibromyalgia (FM). A common feature of these syndromes is that they are multifactorial and present clinically as a mosaic of biologic and psychologic phenotypes. Despite intense largely target organ-based drug development efforts existing treatments are unsatisfactory. The current proposal co-directed by experienced senior investigators from gastroenterology and urology builds on this interdisciplinary view and aims to characterize the interactions of biological and environmental vulnerability factors to shape behavioral and neurobiological endophenotypes and ultimately clinical phenotypes in IC/PBS. The 3 Projects of the proposal address the following 3 areas: Project 1 is a targeted epidemiological project studying the impact of genetic markers early life experiences and adult stress on IC/PBS symptoms and comorbid pain syndromes. Project 2 is a clinical/translational study in a small cohort of IC/PBS patients (and in a rodent model of early life and chronic stress) which aims at characterizing several neurobiological and behavioral endophenotypes and identifying their relationship to gene polymorphisms. Project 3 is a basic science study in IC/PBS patients and in the same rodent stress model which aims at studying cellular and molecular consequences of altered noradrenergic/SNS signaling on the urothelium and spinal glial cells. These projects involve a wide range of epidemiological psychophysiological neurobiological and molecular techniques performed by an interdisciplinary group of investigators ranging from Urology Gastroenterology Epidemiology and Neuroscience who have access to an established infrastructure to study neurovisceral interactions and who have extensive previous experience in the study of functional pain syndromes including IBS and IC/PBS. The projects closely interact with each other and project investigators have been interacting with a large group of researchers and affiliated institutions. By deconstructing the complex symptom-based syndrome of IC/PBS into distinct neurobiological and behavioral endophenotypes we anticipate the identification of more rationale drug development targets and ultimately the development of more effective therapies.    ","657024",

By merging them into an integrated open source open development research platform we will address a number of their individual limitations. The current software tools provide resources for spectral simulation RF pulse design and spectral data analysis (GAVA/GAMMA MatPulse and VeSPA programs respectively). The proposed research platform will be called MrSPA (Magnetic Resonance Simulation Pulse design and Analysis). Clinical MRS research design encompasses: 1) the research question 2) pulse sequence re-design for specific data acquisition and 3) robust spectral processing and data analysis. Amalgamation of the three programs into an integrated development platform will facilitate all three steps.

The aims of the first part of this proposal will focus on the unification and integration of the initial programs into one package. This process will address a number of limitations of the current software including: non-standard data access closed source multiple language software that complicates algorithm extension and comparison lack of integration between programs for sharing prior information and incomplete or missing documentation and educational content. The aims of the second half of this proposal will expand the development platform functionality both globally via distributed computing options plug-and-play extensibility and networked data sharing; and also in each module with specific tools and algorithms. Software will be made available online for free. We will provide and support a simple transition pathway for the user communities of the current programs. We will partner with the NIPY consortium (NeuroImaging in Python) to provide industry standard open development tools and to facilitate dissemination of both easy to install packages for users and for source code repository access for developers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will update and expand upon three existing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) software tools by merging them into a single integrated research platform. MRS is a powerful non-invasive tool for quantifying metabolite changes both in vivo and in vitro without the use of ionizing radiation. The importance of MRS as a clinical investigation tool is its potential to detect disease specific changes that may be observed where only non-specific MR imaging (MRI) findings are manifested or metabolic changes that may occur in the absence of structural abnormalities seen using MRI alone. It has found applications clinically in normal aging traumatic brain injury multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's disease epilepsy and brain tumor evaluation to name a few and an even wider spread of applications in animal and in vitro experiments. Clinical MRS research has experienced a tremendous growth in the last decade owing to the rapid development of the necessary technology to support higher magnetic field MR scanners and the great progress made in various MR data acquisition schemes. Merging these three MRS tools into an integrated platform will facilitate and encourage the use of comprehensive MRS research designs that incorporate all steps of data acquisition and analysis to investigate specific research questions.      ","415228",

We propose to measure cell function before cell therapy injections enabling us to quantify relationships between cell function results and subsequent clinical outcomes. Specifically we aim to test cell migration and nitric oxide activity based on the proven utility of these mechanisms in predicting myocardial neovasculogenesis. Whereas the source of transplanted cells are the same (bone marrow) for all three CCTRN trials (FOCUS TIME and Late TIME) the clinical response measures of interest for this proposal are the primary clinical outcomes of the respective trial. The ability to predict outcome of a cell therapeutic intervention based on functional characteristics of the injected cells will greatly accelerate development of methods to improve cell function and the pace of cell therapy.

This proposal establishes a CCTRN ancillary functional studies laboratory consortium to bridge the gap between cells injected and clinical outcome.

Efforts to address these issues have tackled the problem from two opposite perspectives: 1. Improvements in microscopy have enabled resolution of spectrally distinct signals at a molecular scale under ideal conditions; and 2. Energy transfer approaches have allowed detection of complexes where two proteins are in very close contact. This proposal introduces a third approach that fills the gap in resolution between the two former methods and avoids many of the compromises inherent in them. This approach is based on formation of a fluorescent complex when the association between two non-fluorescent protein fragments is facilitated by tethering the fragments in a macromolecular complex. Earlier adaptations of this approach are known as bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and ubiquitin-mediated fluorescence complementation (UbFC). These earlier approaches have significant limitations that are due to the lack of optimization of the fluorescent protein fragments (BiFC probes) for purposes of the assay. The proposed research seeks to eliminate these limitations through systematic in vitro evolution and protein design strategies. The research team will develop novel BiFC probes that will enable imaging of cellular processes that have not been previously imaged due to limitations inherent in existing methods. To validate the universal utility of the BiFC probes they will be used to image molecular events involving bacteria plants and animal cells. Public Health Relevance: Many cellular functions require that multiple components come together to form a complex. We propose to develop new methods that will enable us to see the complexes formed by specific combinations of components. These methods are analogous to linking a light bulb to one component and a battery to the other. This work will improve our understanding of interactions among cellular components that are important for the health of the cell and the organism.      ","679260",

These methods may be collectively termed Single-Molecule Active Control Microscopy (SMACM) because single emitting molecules are used as nanometer-scale light sources and these emitters must be actively turned on and off to be sure that only a few molecules are emitting at any given time. Photoactivatable fluorescent protein fusions have been used for SMACM but these emitters are large and may perturb the biological system. Though some emitters such as quantum dots provide high photostability many additional properties are simultaneously required for advanced single-molecule imaging in cells such as ease of functionalization control of photophysics and photochemistry and ease of targeting to specific cellular structures. Organic synthesis can make a huge array of ""small"" molecules with multiple tailored functionalities and the present application makes use of this high degree of flexibility to develop new targeted single-molecule emitters with active control capabilities This research will attack the problem of 3-D superresolution imaging with three interconnected thrusts which combine the skills of four investigators expert in organic synthesis single-molecule imaging chemistry for cellular targeting and regulatory protein localization in bacterial cells. First organic synthesis will generate new fluorophores with ""turn-on"" capability where chemical reactivity is used to generate emission only when two protofluorophores are allowed to react or where secondary photochemical illumination creates a fluorescent molecule in situ. Secondary illumination will also be used to photoswitch molecules on and off for additional control. The utility of the turn-on concept is that fluorescence can more easily be generated only where needed; hence backgrounds are lower. The second thrust involves selective targeting of the fluorescent labels to proteins and RNA in the cell. This will be accomplished by N-terminal cysteine labeling and RNA aptamer generation respectively. Finally to validate and challenge the fluorophore development the new emitters will be used at the single-molecule level to image specific subwavelength structures both in eukaryotic and in tiny bacterial cells. The results of this research will be to greatly extend the availability of high-resolution probes for cellular imaging at the single-molecule level thus enabling a much deeper understanding of cellular functions. By providing a large new array of controllable and targeted single-molecule emitters the ability of the researcher to noninvasively look inside cells will be extended into the nanoscale regime of the single-molecule emitters themselves. Public Health Relevance: The understanding of biological systems is intimately connected with unraveling disease mechanisms and to understand the operation of the cell optical imaging has long been an essential method by virtue of its generally noninvasive character its capacity to assess from a distance and its ability to observe time- dependent dynamical processes. In the cell many small molecular machines operate one at a time therefore scientists are now routinely observing individual single molecules one by one to examine the behavior of each without averaging over many inequivalent copies. To observe single molecules in cells at the spatial scale of a few tens of nm new actively controllable and targetable emitting labels are required and this proposed research combines the skills of four investigators to design synthesize and optimize a large and novel class of molecules for labeling individual proteins and RNA in living cells.      ","723020",

The faculty of the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center (CPFRC) are internationally known for translational research in fibromyalgia (FM) and related illnesses including interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). The Center has begun collaborating with a strong group of colleagues from the DM Urology Department. These investigators have expertise that spans the translational ""bench to community"" continuum of IC and chronic pelvic pain. All of our projects will pursue a unifying hypothesis that we feel has been supported in related pain conditions and may underlie IC/PBS: A subset of women with IC/PBS has a ""central"" problem in pain or sensory processing as occurs in FM rather than a disorder confined to the bladder. Project one extends the ongoing NIH-funded RICE study (a cross-sectional epidemiological study that queries individuals in the U.S. regarding their current symptoms). This study will 1) examine the natural history of IC/PBS in the general population 2) show that IC/PBS patients in tertiary care clinical samples have higher rates of co-morbid conditions including psychological co-morbidities than IC/PBS patients in the population and will also identify a population-based cohort of IC/PBS patients in the Michigan region that can be recruited for studies at our discovery site. Project two will perform experimental sensory testing and functional neuroimaging in women with IC/PBS healthy controls and FM patients. We hypothesize that IC/PBS patients are diffusely sensitive to pain and other sensory stimuli similar to FM patients. Project three will further explore the precise reason(s) for the augmented pain and sensory processing seen in IC/PBS. A specific molecular probe will test whether a subset of IC/PBS patients has attenuated descending analgesic activity that is restored via administration of a selective noradrenergic/serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (NSRI) milnacipran. We hypothesize that we will show via experimental pain testing and functional neuroimaging that there is attenuated descending analgesic activity in some IC/PBS patients and that improvements in these experimental parameters will be accompanied by improvement in pain and urinary urgency/frequency. We also hypothesize that certain genetic polymorphisms in COMT and beta-2 and-3 adrenoreceptors will predict the magnitude of the descending analgesic response and response to a NSRI.    ","954456",

PD is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gingiva that leads to enhanced osteoclastogenesis of alveolar bone in the jaw and destruction of periodontal ligaments and other tooth-supporting structures. Initiation and progression of PD is caused by a complex ecology of anaerobic bacteria particularly the ""red complex"" of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) Treponema denticola and the main focus of this application Tanerella forsythia (formerly Bacteroides forsythus). However most of the pathology and bone destruction in PD are actually mediated by an inappropriate immune response which leads to an imbalance in osteoclastogenesis through the combined action of inflammatory cytokines T and B lymphocytes and other aspects of adaptive and innate immunity. The role of T helper cells in PD pathogenesis has been controversial. Studies in humans and experimental animals have suggested a homeostatic role for T cells or even a protective role for cell-mediated immunity. There is also some evidence for suppression of T cell-mediated immunity in advanced periodontitis and P. gingivalis exerts a downregulatory effect on CD4+ cells in mice. Conversely mice deficient in T cells or various T cell cytokines are almost completely protected from alveolar bone destruction and certain subtypes of T helper cells are characteristic of progressive PD lesions in humans and mice. Thus it is still not clear how T cells contribute to host defense/pathology in PD. Part of the confusion may stem from the fact that T helper (Th) cell biology is incompletely understood. In the last few years a major revolution in understanding CD4+ Th subsets occurred with the discovery of a new population of Th cells that secrete IL-17 and hence are termed ""Th17."" Th17 cells are distinct from the classic Th1 and Th2 populations and have been found to be the major T cell mediators of host defense against extracellular pathogens but also activators of chronic inflammation in autoimmunity. We have recently demonstrated that IL-17 signaling protects against bone loss in a mouse model of PD contrary to the intuitive prediction that IL- 17 inflammatory signaling promotes bone loss in PD. Therefore the overall goal of this application is to assess the contributions of the three major types of Th cells to mediating alveolar bone loss and/or host defense against T. forsythia using mouse models with targeted deletions in T cell subsets or Th-specific cytokines. Project Narrative: One of the most common forms of bone loss in humans occurs in periodontal disease (PD). PD is initiated by anaerobic bacteria such as Tanerella forsythia that colonize and invade the oral cavity in the gingival space adjacent to teeth but it is the inflammatory events mediated by the immune system that actually triggers bone loss. The goal of this application is to define the nature of the inflammatory T cell response to periodontal bone loss mediated by Tanerella forsythia taking into account recent advances in the field of T cell immunology.      ","390311",

An important response to the epidemic is the global scale-up of access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs potentially delivering ART to millions of infected individuals. A barrier to successful long term treatment is the emergence of drug resistance caused by mutations selected in viral genes which are both a cause and a consequence of ART failure. Knowledge about drug resistance comes largely from the US and Europe focused on one HIV-1 variant subtype B. However 90% of infections globally are in resource limited settings in Africa and Asia where other distinct non-B HIV-1 subtypes predominate. There is strong preliminary evidence that pre-therapy genotypes differ among subtypes and that distinct mutations at positions related to resistance may occur even before treatment among non-B subtypes. Furthermore distinct new mutations are detected in non-B subtypes after drug-exposure. Information on susceptibility and resistance of non-B viruses is critical for strategies to sustain the benefit of ART. Prevalence and incidence of transmitted and acquired drug resistance will drive decisions about diagnostic testing initial and second-line therapies in public health HIV treatment programs in resource limited settings. The focus of this proposal is to build the scientific infrastructure for surveillance and monitoring of drug resistance in three Resource-limited settings where specific non- B subtypes predominate. Through these studies we will develop a robust sequence database of HIV-1 non-B variants for genotypic analyses and phenotypic validation of resistance mutations and patterns. We have designed a program to first develop quality assured low cost drug resistance monitoring strategies using dried filter specimens for resistance testing. These strategies will be implemented in Thailand India and china to study differences between HIV-1 subtypes in drug resistance to current first-line WHO- recommended treatment regimens. In collaboration with Monogram Biosciences we will assess the importance of mutations and patterns in these samples using an advanced method for phenotypic resistance testing. The goals of this proposal are to (i) validate low-cost resistance testing; (ii) determine frequency and patterns of virological failure and drug resistance after 1 and 2 years of ART; and (iii) conduct genotypic analyses and phenotypic validation of subtype-specific mutations and patterns.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HIV-1 pandemic is a global emergency caused by multiple subtypes. Evolution of anti-HIV drug resistance is the main cause and consequence of drug treatment failure. Most knowledge about drug resistance stems from work in the US and Europe on the relatively uncommon subtype B HIV-1. In resource limited settings where the majority of the pandemic prevails non-B subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRF) predominate. Treatment access programs are rapidly increasing the numbers of AIDS patients throughout the world who are receiving combinations of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Our long-term goal is to determine the how different subtypes of HIV-1 respond to treatment with antiretroviral drugs and the significance of subtype in the selection and the evolution of drug resistance.      ","737062",

Full sequence data in a population sample will no longer suffer from problems of ascertainment bias and the full spectrum of population genetic models may be fitted to the data. But there remains a serious challenge to identify optimal means of establishing association between sequence variants and disease risk and we will pursue four aims toward this goal. Specific Aim 1 will consider the role of rare variants starting with the challenge of calling singleton heterozygous sites in large samples and dealing with errors in these calls. Rare variants do not provide statistical power to be tested for phenotype associations individually but a variety of tests of collective effects of rare variants are proposed. The basic idea of considering the collections of genotypic attributes that distinguish the phenotypic tails of the distribution of measured genotypes will be explored extensively. Specific Aim 2 will consider the case of dense resequencing of specific candidate genome regions in case-control and cohort studies. Both unphased multi-site genotype data and phased haplotypes inferred from the genotype data represent samples from a population that may or may not fit well-studied population genetic and demographic models. The causal model connecting phenotype to genotype likely includes an integration of effects of multiple SNPs including possibly highly non-additive effects. We propose a likelihood ratio based method that calculates the probability of observing the phenotypic data under a specific genetic model that can account for the combined effect of multiple SNPs. Specific Aim 3 will extend the model of Aim 2 to a Bayesian setting applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling from the posterior distribution of effects. This will allow the test to be applied to much larger data sets including resequencing of regions after genome-wide association studies. Specific Aim 4 develops an improved and flexible Bayesian association mapping approach that can integrate disparate sources of data (such as age intermediate phenotype environment etc.) to estimate the inflation of risk of disease for single or combinations of genetic variants environmental conditional age or combinations of factors. For all four aims approaches will be tested with sample resequencing data as well as genotypic data generated by simulation of the coalescent with recombination under realistic human demographic models. In both cases phenotypes will be specified by a variety of genetic models. Data from the Framingham Heart Study from GAIN genome-wide studies and from the Sanger Institute data on transcript abundance of HapMap samples will be used to test the methods. DNA resequencing of large samples of individuals from case/control and cohort studies will yield information about associations with disease risk only if the properties of statistical models that describe the causal associations between genotype and phenotype are fully explored. This project is designed to develop an analytical framework that uses the underlying structure of the genetic data (based on population genetic principles) to provide the maximum statistical power for inference of association when many SNPs within the gene may contribute a small non-additive portion of the increased risk. These methods will also be extended to include prior information about molecular mechanisms of gene function where available as well as environmental contributions to disease risk.      ","382957",

Despite the many advances in medical practice and the availability of effective anti-P. carinii antibiotics the morbidity and mortality due to P. carinii pneumonia has changed little in the last 20 years and remains unacceptably high. Overall mortality is about 10%/episode in AIDS patients and even higher up to 40%/episode in non- AIDS patients. This is likely related to the fact that effective antibiotic-mediated killing of Pc does not immediately reduce the severe immunopathological component of PcP that is driven by the concurrent presence of T cells and Pc antigen in the lung. We have established over the past 9 years the role of the Pc-specific immune-mediated inflammatory response in the immunopathogenesis of lung injury associated with PcP. Specifically we have demonstrated a critical role for CD8+ T cells in the initiation of this inflammatory response in the CD4+ T cell depleted host. Our working hypothesis is that the host's T cell-mediated immune response to infection by P. carinii is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of PcP and that understanding how this injury progresses is absolutely critical to the effective control of this response and improving patient outcomes. In addition to targeting T cells we have identified specific inflammatory events downstream of T cell activation that may have roles in the generation and persistence of PcP-related inflammatory lung injury. These events include the activation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) the production of TNF-1 and enhanced cell signaling through NF-kB and MAPK. Our goal is to further characterize the cellular and molecular events leading to lung injury during PcP for the purpose of identifying specific pathways or combinations of pathways that lend themselves to therapeutic intervention. ""Proof of principle"" and candidate pathways have been identified during our initial studies. We are optimistic that the experiments outlined herein will lead to translational clinical trials as emphasized in the NIH roadmap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The morbidity and mortality due to P. carinii pneumonia has changed little in the last 20 years and remains unacceptably high. Overall mortality is about 10%/episode in AIDS patients and even higher up to 40%/episode in non-AIDS patients. The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to lead to a translational clinical trial designed to improve the management of patients with P. carinii pneumonia.      ","383920",

The integrated model suggests that the consequences of HIV/AIDS stigma (e.g. psychological symptoms and sexually risky behavior) depend on both the manner in which community members express prejudice (subtle or blatant) and on individual differences in vulnerability to stigma and coping with stigma among people with HIV/AIDS living in these communities. This model which was used to interpret the findings of the current project suggests three hypotheses that will be examined in the proposed project. The first is that coping with high levels of perceived HIV/AIDS stigma with disengagement (i.e. avoidance) coping will be related to the social integration of people with HIV/AIDS into their communities and their sexual behavior. The second hypothesis is that psychological symptoms may be both a consequence of perceived HIV/AIDS stigma and/or may make people with HIV/AIDS vulnerable to perceiving that they are stigmatized. The third hypothesis is that perceived HIV/AIDS stigmatization by people with HIV/AIDS will depend on the type of prejudice (implicit/subtle or blatant) that is expressed by the community in which they live and on their individual vulnerability to stigmatization. These hypotheses will be tested with 250 participants with HIV/AIDS who will complete a longitudinal study to assess perceived stigma coping with stigma psychological symptoms and sexual risk behavior a diary measure in which they record their daily experiences with stigmatization and an experiment in which they interpret how prejudiced people from the community are based on a sample of their behavior. Community subtle and blatant prejudice toward people with HIV/AIDS will be assessed by a survey of residents of the communities in which participants with HIV/AIDS live. Findings of this project will be useful in designing interventions by increasing understanding of the type and the amount of HIV/AIDS stigma people with HIV/AIDS face in their communities the role that individual vulnerability plays in the experience of HIV/AIDS stigmatization and the role that coping with stigma plays in influencing the relationship between experienced stigma and important outcomes (e.g. sexually risky behavior and psychological symptoms). Findings also will indicate whether reductions in stigma may have unintended results (i.e. paradoxical increases in risky sexual behavior) unless there is a better understanding of how community context individual vulnerabilities to stigmatization and coping with stigma affect the outcomes of people with HIV/AIDS.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE HIV/AIDS stigma has been identified as a critical issue for people with HIV/AIDS particularly those living outside of metropolitan areas. The goal is to identify individual differences and community level variables that make people with HIV/AIDS vulnerable or resilient to the adverse consequences of HIV/AIDS stigma. The public health consequences to be examined are psychological symptoms including clinical levels of anxiety and depression that characterize the study population and sexual behaviors that risk the transmission of the virus.            ","706753",

The mechanism by which IRBP protects retinoids from isomeric and oxidative degradation while targeting their delivery/release between the above cells during the visual cycle is poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to understand at the molecular level how IRBP accomplishes its remarkable functions. The mechanism underlying IRBP's function or role in disease remains unknown because little is understood about its structure-function relationships. Its structure is unusual being composed of tandem homologous ""modules"" each ~300 residues in length. Although the individual modules have some functional activity they are not equivalent and important interactions take place between them. A critical gap is that little is known about the structure of the full-length protein and quaternary association of the ""modules"". However obtaining IRBP at the concentrations needed for X-ray crystallography has been problematic as the protein denatures and precipitates when concentrated above 3 mgs/ml. In the current funding period we purified to homogeneity full-length bovine xenopus human and zebrafish IRBPs in stable and functionally active pristine forms devoid of fusion tags. These protein solutions can now be readily concentrated without denaturation or precipitation. We have optimized conditions for growing diffraction-quality crystals of these full-length IRBPs. Preliminary structure elucidation analysis for Xenopus IRBP suggests that the single module structure may be substantially modified in the full-length functional protein. Analyses of the expression purification stability crystallization ligand-binding anti-oxidant activity and homology-modeling data on these IRBPs have led to our hypothesis that quaternary association of the ""modules"" contributes to the structural scaffold(s) that bind and protect retinoids from degradation and that the ""modules"" contribute unequally in these roles as well as in target retinoid delivery and release at the cell surface. This hypothesis will be evaluated through the following complementary aims. Aim 1: To determine the crystal structures of IRBPs composed of four modules (human bovine Xenopus) and two modules (zebrafish). Aim 2: To define binding-interactions of physiologically relevant ligands with IRBP and elucidate the molecular basis of IRBP's protective/anti-oxidant roles. Aim 3: To determine how IRBP efficiently targets retinoid removal/delivery. Aim 4: To determine the structural and functional ""hot-spots"" in IRBP.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mechanism by which IRBP protects retinoids from isomeric and oxidative degradation while targeting their delivery/release between photoreceptors retinal pigmented epithelium and Mller cells during the visual cycle is poorly understood.

The etiology of MDS is unknown and the factors leading to AML progression are not well characterized. With similarity to other cancer patients MDS patients have defects in proximal T-cell receptor signaling pathways and altered T-cell homeostasis. A new class of interesting therapeutic drugs (IMiDs) derived from the parent compound thalidomide has shown activity in a variety of inflammatory autoimmune and neoplastic diseases including MDS where clinical responses were observed and the drug was awarded FDA approval in select patients. Lenalidomide as well as other IMiDs possess a unique ability to augment T-cell function by substituting for inadequate secondary antigen-independent co-stimulatory signals through an unknown mechanism that involves activation of the CD28 receptor. Lenalidomide was able to reverse peripheral T-cell anergy enhance TH1-type cytokine responses and change T-cell homeostasis in patients with MDS. Although treatments to activate T-cell signaling and expansion have been used activation in general does not alter T-cell subset distribution or preferentially activate antigen-specific T-cells. Importantly animal models of IMiDs combined with cancer vaccines suggest that these drugs selectively enhance anti-tumor specific T-cell responses. Therefore we hypothesize that reversal of the T-cell signaling defects and improved T-cell homeostasis with lenalidomide along with a cellular vaccine that is cross-reactive to endogenous tumor antigens should result in an effective therapeutic treatment that will prevent leukemia progression in MDS. To examine the proposed hypothesis we will perform three specific aims. In Aim 1 the molecular mechanism of lenalidomide-induced proximal T-cell receptor signaling events will be investigated in vitro. We found that lenalidomide acts as an inhibitor of PP2A phosphatase activity. PP2A is known to bind and possibly repress the YXXM PI3K binding motif in the CD28 receptor intracellular domain that recruits and/or activates proximal signaling intermediates at the level of the T-cell/CD28 pathway. To determine whether inhibition of PP2A repression in the YXXM region is responsible for the co-stimulatory function of lenalidomide in vitro binding assays protein tyrosine kinase activation assays phosphatase function genetic manipulation of signaling components in primary cells and overexpression of the CD28 receptor carrying genetic mutations in the YXXM region will be performed. In Aim 2 studies are designed to identify the mechanisms responsible for changes in T-cell population dynamics in response to leukemia-associated antigens after MDS patients are treated in vivo with lenalidomide therapy. As an ultimate test of our hypothesis we plan to perform a Phase I dose-escalation trial of the K562 ""bystander"" cellular vaccine that is transduced with the genes for GM-CSF and CD40L in combination with the FDA-approved dose of lenalidomide in high-risk MDS patients. The goal of Aim 3 is to determine whether this vaccine/lenalidomide therapy modulates antigen-specific T-cell response against endogenous leukemia-associated antigens present in the bone marrow of MDS patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by defective blood formation and high risk for leukemia development and primarily occur in individuals over the age of 65 years old. New strategies of treatment are needed for age-related diseases such as MDS as the US population ages. For tumor vaccine therapies to produce clinical responses in MDS and in cancer patients appropriate antigen selection intact antigen presentation and T-cell function are all critical. We propose a new combination therapy in which a novel cellular vaccine will be combined with a new drug to attack all aspects of this problem. We believe that this new treatment strategy is best tested in the setting of high-risk MDS that generally have poor survival limited treatment options and who may have a clinical response to the drug alone. Mechanistic studies will aide our understanding of T-cell immunity and improve our ability to utilize this form of immunotherapy and other forms for the treatment of cancer in general.      ","288000",

Our Data Coordinating Center will be led jointly by Andrea LaCroix and Garnet Anderson who have served together as Co-Principal Investigators of the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Coordinating Center for over a decade. The MSI- FLASH network has five clinical sites: Boston (PIs: Lee Cohen and Hadine Joffe) Indianapolis (PI: Janet Carpenter) Oakland (PIs: Barbara Sternfeld and Bette Caan) Philadelphia (PI: Ellen Freeman) and Seattle (PIs: Katherine Newton and Susan Reed). This multidisciplinary investigator group proposes five randomized controlled trials testing a range of behavioral hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacologic interventions to treat hot flashes. The specific trial proposed by our Boston site will test the relative efficacy of low-dose estrogen therapy and the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine for the treatment of hot flashes. This randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial includes: 1) a ""head-to-head"" comparison of the efficacy of estrogen and paroxetine; 2) a comparison of each intervention with placebo; 3) an assessment of potential modulating effects of co-occurring menopausal symptoms of sleep disturbance depression and anxiety; and 4) an examination of the complex inter-relationships between hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms using both subjective and objective measurements of hot flashes and sleep patterns. The Boston clinical site investigators have extensive experience with both hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacologic trials as well as with behavioral interventions and are well-positioned to collaborate on trials proposed by other MSI-FLASH clinical site investigators. Results of our proposed clinical trial will advance the treatment of hot flashes by establishing the relative efficacy of first-line pharmacologic treatments and determining whether specific clinical characteristics modulate response to treatment.      ","334563",

This study proposes to rigorously test the effects of a long-term (3-year) school-randomized universal preventive intervention called 4Rs (Reading Writing Respect and Resolution) on children's health risk behaviors as they make the transition from elementary to middle school. Specifically the proposed study will: (1) test whether 4Rs produces changes in children's aggression/violence depression substance use and school disengagement/failure over the transition from elementary to middle school; (2) examine the specific causal processes by which the preventive intervention affects children's health risk behaviors in middle school; (3) test differential effects of 4Rs on children's health risk behaviors for subgroups of ""developmentally vulnerable"" and ""ecologically vulnerable"" children as well as for girls and boys; and (4) conduct three additional exploratory sets of analyses to (a) examine issues of comorbidity among the four domains using dynamic continuous latent class modeling (b) explore the impact of two important micro-context mediators of 4R's long-term impact operationalized at the classroom-level including the peer ecology and classroom climate and (c) use propensity score techniques to test the sensitivity of the results after accounting for any take-up of the intervention in the control schools. The 4Rs Program is a whole-school intervention that integrates violence prevention and social and emotional learning strategies into the language arts curriculum for grades K-5 providing a pedagogical link between teaching conflict resolution and fundamental academic skills. In a prior rigorous evaluation an earlier version of this intervention demonstrated promising results in altering children's trajectories of aggression- related cognitions and beliefs behavioral dispositions and interpersonal relationships aggressive/violent behavior and academic achievement over the course of elementary school. The current study proposes to continue to follow over 800 children in 18 New York City elementary schools (9 of which were randomly assigned to receive 4Rs) from the end of elementary school through the final year of middle school. We estimate that the children will move to over 100 middle schools throughout New York City. By testing the effects of a long-term intervention delivered in elementary school on children's subsequent transition to middle school this study hopes to make new contributions to intervention theory and understanding of the onset developmental course and mediating causal process in several key domains of health risk behaviors. Results will be proactively disseminated to local and national public health criminal justice substance use prevention and mental health-related audiences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transition from elementary to middle school is fraught with both opportunity and danger especially for low-income children of color in urban schools. On average rates of health risk behaviors (e.g. violence/aggression and delinquency depression substance use and academic failure) increase during the late elementary and early adolescent years putting children and youth at greater risk for poor future functioning. This project capitalizes on a random assignment study of a universal school-based violence prevention and literacy instruction program to examine (1) the nature and developmental path of several primary health risk behaviors from childhood through early adolescence (2) the degree to which these risk behaviors are modifiable by a universal preventive intervention in elementary school and (3) the important process by which the intervention has its impact.      ","556986",

The general approach involves using mouse models of cancer principally neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors and glioblastoma whose histopathology and angiogenic phenotypes mirror human tumors along with pharmacological agents (monoclonal antibodies hybrid antibody-ligand traps and small molecules) targeting regulatory circuits governing tumor angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. The specific aims of this renewal intend to characterize and identify therapeutic targets for three distinctive mechanisms of evasive resistance to inhibitors of VEGF signaling: Aim 1. Investigate the induction of additional and alternative pro-angiogenic signaling circuits as an evasion mechanism to anti-VEGFR therapy; Aim 2. Evaluate the capability of recruited bone marrow-derived cells (BMD-C) to help circumvent anti-angiogenesis drugs. Aim 3. Elucidate the parameters and assess mechanism-based therapeutic targeting of increased tumor invasiveness in response to angiogenesis inhibition. While much heralded the arrival of angiogenesis inhibitors into the clinic in particular ones targeting the VEGF signaling pathway is not in general resulting in enduring responses but rather transitory periods of improved quality of life (tumor shrinkage or stabilization; months of survival advantage) followed by renewed tumor growth and progression. The postulates forthcoming from this project to be pursued in its renewal are that 1) a component to such relapse is the induction of evasive resistance to VEGF inhibition and 2) therapeutic strategies targeting evasive resistance mechanisms hold promise to produce more enduring anti-angiogenic therapies for human cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While much heralded the arrival of angiogenesis inhibitors into the clinic in particular ones targeting the VEGF signaling pathway is not in general resulting in enduring responses but rather transitory periods of improved quality of life (modest tumor shrinkage or stabilization; months of survival advantage) followed by renewed tumor growth and progression. This project has discovered a basis for such transitory efficacy involving the induction of three 'evasive resistance' mechanisms: revascularization mediated by alternative angiogenic signals recruitment of vascular progenitor cells from the bone marrow and increased invasiveness parameters to be elucidated in this resubmitted competitive renewal application. Targeting such resistance mechanisms holds promise to produce more enduring anti-angiogenic therapies for human cancers.       ","525588",

DLGH1 is a scaffolding protein with multiple protein-protein interaction domains including three PDZ domains and one SH3 domain. Dlgh1 is a homolog of the Drosophila discs-large gene dlg which is a founding member of the eponymous PDZ family of proteins and also of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) family. Studies in Drosophila suggest that dlg is a tumor suppressor because mutation of dlg causes overgrowth of imaginal discs. Studies in both fly and mammalian cells suggest that dlg and its homologs are also involved in establishing and/or maintaining epithelial cell polarity. We have studied mice lacking DLGH1 and found several urogenital defects including sporadic renal agenesis congenital hydronephrosis and reproductive tract abnormalities. We have shown that hydronephrosis is associated with dramatic smooth muscle alignment defects; the normally circular muscle aberrantly aligns in the longitudinal direction. This greatly impairs the squeezing motion of peristalsis such that urine is retained in the kidney. In addition ureteric stromal cells which normally lie between the urothelium and the smooth muscle layers and express Raldh2 are absent from Dlgh1 mutant ureters. The absence of these cells could also affect ureteric function either directly or indirectly. Immunofluorescence studies show that DLGH1 is expressed strongly in the urothelium and weakly in other cells of the ureter. We will determine which cellular compartment must express Dlgh1 for normal smooth muscle cell alignment and for differentiation and/or migration of ureteric stromal cells using a new floxed Dlgh1 allele and appropriate Cre transgenic mice. In addition we will generate chimeric mice to investigate whether DLGH1 acts in a non-cell autonomous fashion. Morphological and functional assessments will be performed to determine the cellular requirements for Dlgh1 expression. Next we will use genetic methods to investigate the hypothesis that the interaction of other DLGH family members with known or suspected DLGH1 binding proteins are compensating in part for the absence of DLGH1. Finally we will use in vitro methods to define the role of DLGH1 in cell migration polarization and signaling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congenital urinary tract abnormalities are a relatively common health problem in the human population and are responsible for a significant number of cases of progressive renal disease. We have generated a novel mouse model of hydronephrosis (Dlgh1-/- mice) involving the misalignment of ureteric smooth muscle which is commonly found in human cases of urinary tract obstruction. A better understanding of the biology of DLGH1 could have important implications for understanding and perhaps for treatment or prevention of urinary tract abnormalities in humans.      ","323000",

We have previously reported that select NSAIDS were capable of selectively modulating Abeta42. More recently we have found that numerous compounds increase Abeta42. Abeta42 modulating agents (generically referred to as gamma-secretase modulators or GSMs) minimally alter total Abeta production but shift the gamma-secretase cleavage site. Abeta42 lowering GSMs increase the production of shorter Abeta peptides and raising agents decrease the levels of shorter Abeta peptides. Current data using novel photoaffinity ligands that modulate Abeta42 cleavage indicate that Abeta42 modulating agents alter production and aggregation of Abeta by binding to a site within the Abeta region of APP carboxyl terminal fragments (CTFs). We hypothesize that binding of the Abeta region of APP CTFs alters the conformation of the APP CTF or its position in the membrane resulting in altered gamma-secretase cleavage and following cleavage compound binding alters Abeta aggregation. We outline a number of studies to extend our current data that support this hypothesis. We will also evaluate the linked hypotheses regarding the in vivo mechanism of action of Abeta42 lowering NSAIDs and other Abeta42 altering agents. We will perform chronic dosing studies with drug-like Abeta42 lowering and raising agents in APP and BRI-Abeta42 mouse models to evaluate the relative contribution of altering Abeta42 production vs. altering aggregation with respect to effect on Abeta loads and other AD-like pathologies. We will also determine if elevations in shorter Abeta peptides are protective. For these later studies we will use recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) to deliver BRI-Abeta fusion constructs encoding Abeta 1-34 1-37 and 1-38 to the brain of neonatal APP mice. This methodology creates ""somatic brain transgenics"" and will allow us to rapidly evaluate the effects of shorter Abeta peptides on Abeta deposition. Effects on Abeta deposition and synaptic transmission will be evaluated. The influence of shorter Abeta peptides on Abeta42 aggregation in vitro will also be evaluated in vitro. These studies should provide additional insight into the mechanisms whereby Abeta42 modulating agents shift Abeta cleavage and how they exert their protective effects in vivo.

Recent results show more adult-like productions in certain contexts suggesting that children's phonological and morphological representations are more robust than often assumed. Previous acoustic/phonetic studies have also shown that children sometimes make systematic acoustic or gestural feature contrasts not perceived as such by adults (covert contrasts). However research on such covert contrast has been limited to a few case studies. Little is therefore known about the extent of these processes across young normally developing learners nor about how this relates to early variability in natural speech. This proposal addresses this problem by using acoustic and articulatory measures to test the hypothesis that many of children's early phonological and morphological representations are more adult-like than they appear. To investigate this issue we draw on recent theoretical and empirical work on adult speech where variability in production has been analyzed in terms of individual acoustic/articulatory cues to grammatical feature contrasts. However most of this research to date has focused on the beginnings of words (onsets): very little is known about how adults or children produce contrasts at the ends of words where languages like English encode important grammatical morphemes. We therefore extend and compare previous findings to the acoustic/phonetics of child- directed speech (by adults) and to child speech focusing on the question of when and how children acquire word-final (coda) consonants. To do this we first carry out detailed acoustic analyses of existing adult and child speech corpora focusing on the production of simple non-inflected and inflected words (e.g. dig digs). We then compare these results with those of 2-year-old's speech productions under more controlled experimental conditions. The goal is to better understand the principles that underlie phonological and morphological variation in child speech. We hypothesize that between-speaker variability will occur most often for feature contrasts that are signaled by multiple articulatory gestures and acoustic cues (e.g. the voicing of word-final consonants) where developing speakers may initially implement different feature cues. In contrast we hypothesize that within- speaker variability will be highly predictable and context dependent (e.g. sensitive to word complexity and position within the utterance) reflecting constraints on phonological form. The results will provide a framework for better understanding children's early knowledge of phonological and morphological structure and will lay the foundation for a developmental model of language planning. This will have implications for more accurate diagnosis and design of interventions for both child and adult populations with language impairments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The findings from this research will reveal much about the structure of children's early phonological and morphological representations and how these develop over time. In so doing they will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying variability in children's productions and the possible impact of input complexity and contextual factors in understanding between-speaker and within-speaker variability in language production. These findings will lay the foundation for constructing a developmental model of language planning providing a framework for designing more effective tools for diagnosing and treating aspects of language impairment.      ","312330",

The goal of the current application is to test a model that examines vulnerability factors for people with concealable stigmatized identities. Our sample will include 5 concealable stigmatized identities: mental illness childhood abuse (physical emotional sexual) rape substance abuse and relationship violence. These five identities were chosen because they are common stigmatized and related to increased psychological distress. Participants will be drawn from a diverse community sample composed of people both currently seeking psychological treatment and those not in treatment. There are three specific aims: Our first specific aim is to test a model of vulnerability factors for psychological distress for people with concealable stigmatized identities. Based on stigma theory and research four factors internal to the stigma target (anticipated stigma centrality of the identity salience of the identity and internalization of negative stereotypes) and one factor external to the stigma target (level of cultural stigma attached to the identity) are predicted to explain distress. Using structural equation modeling we will also examine a mediated model in which the effect of anticipated stigma on distress is mediated through increased centrality and salience. We hypothesize that anticipating more devaluation due to one's stigmatized identity will lead to increased identity centrality and salience which in turn result in increased distress. Level of cultural stigma is predicted to have only a direct effect on distress. Our second specific aim is to examine whether the vulnerability factors in our model predict general health functioning and if so whether this effect is mediated through psychological distress. Our third specific aim is to compare model fit across ethnicity. Research has shown both physical and mental health disparities between minority and majority Americans. We hypothesize that compared to European Americans African Americans and Latinos will show exacerbated concealed stigma effects and these effects will be predicted by previous experiences with discrimination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will provide a model of risk factors to predict who is likely to be vulnerable to psychological distress and decreased health functioning due to concealable stigmatized identities. Ultimately such a model may have its greatest impact on the enhancement of treatment outcomes by increasing access utilization and treatment effectiveness of therapeutic interventions as well as reducing the heavy disability burden associated with untreated concealed stigmas.      ","171000",

Because the aged represent an ever-growing segment of the populations in the western world morbidities due to infection are significant. We are interested in identifying alleles that underlie this age-acquired susceptibility. We developed a mouse model of human babesiosis due Babesia microti an emerging infection particularly severe in the aged. We observed that young DBA/2 mice experience significant parasitemia but young C57BL/6 B10.D2 and BALB/c mice do not. In DBA/2 mice an early phase characterized by an intense and transient parasitemia is followed by a late phase of low grade but persistent parasitemia. As age advances both acute and chronic parasitemia become greater in DBA/2 but not in C57BL/6 B10.D2 or BALB/c mice. Using B10.D2 x DBA/2 (BXD) and BALB/c x DBA/2 (CXD) crosses as well as chromosome substitution mice we have established that i) resistance is a complex trait in young and old mice and ii) acute resistance in young mice maps to QTL that differ from those of old mice. We conclude that the greater susceptibility of old DBA/2 mice maps to age-restricted QTL. We now propose to identify resistance and susceptibility alleles and to uncover how they modulate the response to B. microti infection. In Aim#1 we will identify the major genetic determinants of acute resistance in old mice of the BXD cross. In Aim#2 we will identify the major genetic determinants of acute resistance in old mice of the CXD cross. Both aims combine a positional cloning approach with bioinformatic analyses and gene expression studies. In Aim#3 we will identify the cells that contribute to resistance and are affected by the polymorphisms underlying the major QTL. Strain differences in cell function will be studied and used to guide the genetic analysis. We are hopeful that the identification of age-sensitive polymorphisms that modulate immune resistance of old mice to babesiosis may inform the search of alleles that predispose aged individuals to infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As they age many people become more susceptible to infection. The reasons are poorly understood. We are exploring the genes that render aged mice susceptible to infection. Because there is great similarity between the genes of mice and humans we believe our discoveries in mice will aid work to understand the genetic basis of age-related susceptibility to infection in humans.      ","346717",

The numbers of cases as well as the rate has risen in recent years because of the increasing numbers of cataract surgery cases increasing age of patients and potentially increasing resistance of microbes to prophylactic measures and their ability to form biofilms on new lens materials. Antibiotic resistance among Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis has become an issue of considerable public health concern. This competing renewal aims to continue research that has led to the delineation of specific roles of bacterial toxins and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis. A new Co-PI brings additional insights and experience on the host response to the project. The central hypothesis is that after microbes enter the anterior chamber bacterial load or virulence traits foil antimicrobial factors and clearance mechanisms in the aqueous. Microbes then use the same or other virulence traits to promote translocation through the capsule into the posterior segment. In the posterior segment limited vitreous flow and antimicrobial defenses lead to an overwhelming infection and vision loss stemming in part from interference with normal host cell defense mechanisms. This hypothesis will be tested by 1) Determining how virulence traits alter trafficking of bacteria entering the eye through the anterior chamber; 2) Determining how virulence traits foil innate defenses including 2-defensin antimicrobial activities; 3) Identifying the cells first to respond in the anterior and posterior segments to infection; determining the mechanism for detection of invading gram positive bacterium; and determining whether virulence traits affect detection or response; and 4) Determining how an antiapoptotic factor 1B-crystallin is cleaved during S. aureus endophthalmitis which correlates in preliminary studies with retinal damage. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Endophthalmitis frequently leads to vision loss despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy and surgery. This problem is exacerbated by increasing antibiotic resistance of the offending microbe and the increasing age of the patient population. Antibiotic resistance among Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis is now an issue of considerable public health concern. Understanding which bacterial and host factors play critical roles in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will permit new therapeutic approaches and preventive strategies to be developed preserving vision for many patients undergoing cataract extraction or other ocular surgery. It may also have the extrinsic value of leading to new strategies for the treatment and prevention of antibiotic resistant infection at other sites as well.      ","481250",

BCIs can allow people who are severely paralyzed or even ""locked in"" to use brain signals to write communicate with others control their environments access the Internet or operate neuroprostheses. The realization of clinically useful BCI systems requires work in three areas: (1) acquisition of brain signals; (2) signal processing; and (3) clinical implementation. Because these areas involve very different disciplines research groups usually focus on only one area. Thus at the beginning of this BRP despite the exciting achievements of researchers around the world the field had progressed only to the point of laboratory demonstrations in large part because achievements in one area were not integrated with those in others. In the past grant period this BRP changed that landscape. First it developed and disseminated to more than 160 research groups a general-purpose BCI software platform called BCI2000 that facilitates all aspects of interdisciplinary BCI research and development from laboratory to home. Furthermore it used BCI2000 to develop the first BCI system designed for independent home use and successfully tested this prototype in long-term home use by a small group of people severely disabled by ALS. Building on this work the goal of this renewal proposal is to establish the first vertically-integrated BCI research and development program and use it to produce BCI systems that are fully practical for independent use in clinical and home settings. The proposed program extends from signal acquisition to signal processing to application development and clinical implementation. By including and coordinating the activities and achievements in these different areas this program will create and validate the first BCI systems suitable for widespread independent use by people with severe motor disabilities. Each BRP partner is in the forefront of one or more of the essential research areas from hardware design to clinical testing. In limited ways they already collaborate with one another. Working closely together and implementing new ideas they will: (1) improve signal acquisition by developing more reliable robust and convenient chronic methods for recording electroencephalographic activity (EEG) and for exploring the BCI capabilities of electrocorticography (ECoG); (2) optimize adaptive feature extraction and translation algorithms for these signals; and (3) incorporate the results into BCI systems that are fully practical for home and clinical settings and establish the value of these systems for daily use by people with severe motor disabilities. By achieving these aims disseminating the resulting technology and providing other researchers access to its vertically-integrated framework this BRP program should enable BCI research to produce BCIs that actually improve the lives of people with severe motor disabilities.

Chlamydia trachomatis can cause pelvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women and is a co- factor in HIV transmission. The ocular form of Chlamydia has visually impaired over 8 million people and is the leading cause of preventable blindness. With treatment programs failing to stem the disease spread in North America a vaccine is widely acknowledged as the only way by which to prevent the suffering caused by Chlamydia and a goal that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has been pursuing. Previous attempts to create an effective vaccine have proven unsuccessful; in part because Chlamydia is an intracellular pathogen that requires cell mediated immunity. The discovery described in this proposal makes substantial progress towards a Chlamydia vaccine by uniquely surmounting the technical challenges of stimulating T cell immunity. Inspired by the global magnitude of need for a Chlamydia vaccine and propelled by recent advances in proteomic technology genomics and knowledge of Chlamydia immunology we have identified novel antigens critical to the design of an effective C. trachomatis vaccine. The Chlamydia genome has been fully resolved due to support from the NIAID and the proteins from which protective T cell antigens are derived have been inferred. Chlamydia biologists now know the correlate for protective immunity to C. trachomatis is T cell interferon gamma production. In addition excellent murine models exist to evaluate Chlamydia vaccines. We have assembled a team and developed a comprehensive strategy to identify novel T cell antigens and evaluate them in murine models of infection based on a detailed understanding of dendritic cell immunobiology. We believe that we have achieved a breakthrough by using immunoproteomics to identify T cell antigens that are expressed in Chlamydia infected dendritic cells - achieved in part because we have access to the latest generation of mass spectrometry capable of detecting peptides at the subfemtomolar level. Using mass spectrometry the first specific aim of this study is to discover the identity of additional Chlamydia peptides eluted from MHC class I and class II molecules expressed on the surface of Chlamydia infected dendritic cells. Our second specific aim is to uncover the immunological significance of Chlamydia MHC binding peptides. Based on the antigens we know and others we plan to uncover in this study this grant outlines our proposed research to induce cell mediated immunity in animal models a major step in the development of a safe and effective Chlamydia vaccine for humans. Funding for this project will accelerate progress toward a Chlamydia vaccine which will be a major medical achievement for global health.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Often asymptomatic sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infects over 92 million people per year globally and is a leading cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that results in 2-3 million annual cases of infertility and is linked to 60000 maternal deaths per year due to ectopic pregnancy. With control programs failing the development of a safe and effective Chlamydia vaccine would represent a fundamental breakthrough in global health as well as saving in excess of $13.5 billion per year world wide in treatment costs. In this proposal a novel immunoproteomic approach is described based on identifying Chlamydia peptides capable of producing protective cellular immunity that shows great promise towards the development of a Chlamydia vaccine.      ","253800",

The goal of this research proposal is to elucidate the role of the highly conserved GTPase Ran in cell division. The current model suggests that RanGTP functions as a spatial marker that signals the position of the genome in eukaryotic cells. During mitosis RanGTP is thought to promote spindle assembly by stimulating microtubule polymerization and organization in the vicinity of chromosomes. This ""local effect"" results from the chromosomal localization of RCC1 the guanine nucleotide exchange factor that generates RanGTP which binds to transport factors causing them to release cargoes required for spindle assembly. However the nature of the cargoes their mitotic function and the molecular mechanisms underlying the RCC1-Ran-microtubule signaling cascade are still poorly understood. A major experimental approach described in this proposal takes advantage of complex cellular extracts prepared from eggs of the African frog Xenopus laevis that can be studied using biochemical and functional assays. This provides an excellent model system to characterize the components and function of mitotic cargoes to characterize mitotic gradients and to develop novel reconstitution assays. Our aims are: (1) To elucidate the function of a Ran-regulated cargo Rae1 that exists in a complex requiring RNA for its activity and investigate spindle-associated RNAs. (2) To use fluorescent sensors to visualize and characterize RCC1-induced gradients throughout the cell cycle in extracts and in a variety of cell types. (3) To reconstitute RanGTP gradients and spindle assembly using RCC1-coated beads. (4) To use a newly developed small molecule inhibitor of the Ran pathway to further dissect the functions of RanGTP during cell division. In all eukaryotes assembly and function of the spindle apparatus is essential to accurately distribute the genetic information during cell division and errors in this process are associated with birth defects and cancer. The identification and characterization of factors in the mitotic Ran pathway is not only fundamental to our understanding of mitotic and meiotic spindle assembly but may also provide important new insight into our understanding of human diseases.      ","326836",

Cytokinesis   the physical division of a cell in two   is the last critical step of cell division. The complexity and importance of this process has made cytokinesis one of the extensively studied and yet still unsolved problems in cell biology. We and others previously showed that the budding yeast utilizes an actomyosin-based contractile ring to divide as in animal cells. This finding allows us to use this highly tractable model to understand the basic principles and molecular pathways governing cytokinesis. Whereas our previous work followed a conventional approach of classical genetic and biochemical analyses here we propose to take a unique combination of network modeling quantitative imaging evolutionary analysis and genomic and expression microarrays to understand the design principles underlying the molecular complexity. The main questions to be answered in this study are: 1) how a complex network of molecular interactions involving signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins which occur during mitosis ensures asymmetric cell division in a spatially and temporally precise manner; and 2) how in response to large perturbations this cell division system could rapidly evolve to maintain its required functionality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cytokinesis is a crucial event in cell division which is the basis for the growth and development of eukaryotic organisms. Failure in cytokinesis results in polyploidization a common feature of cancer cells that is thought to contribute to genome instability and somatic evolution of cancer.1 2. Asymmetric cytokinesis is also important for the generation of embryonic asymmetry and differentiation of diverse cell types3. Therefore understanding the mechanism and regulation of cytokinsesis is important for treatment or prevention of diseases such as cancer and developmental abnormalities. 1.. Storchova Z. & Pellman D.

These devices often fail clinically due degeneration and pathologic calcification. Understanding degenerative failure of BHVs in the absence of calcification is rarely addressed. In the previous grant period we showed that valvular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are lost during tissue fixation and after implantation. GAG-degrading enzymes either present in the valve tissue or infiltrated after in vivo implantation are a major cause of GAG degeneration. Loss of GAGs from BHVs leads to decreased tissue flexural rigidity loss of hysteresis and collagen structural deterioration. Maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the processed tissues is essential for a durable BHV. We found that chemical fixatives alone are only partially effective in preventing GAG loss from BHVs. Our recent results show that addition of neomycin an inhibitor of GAG-degrading enzymes in combination with chemical GAG fixation by carbodiimide crosslinking prior to routine glutaraldehyde (GLUT) crosslinking leads to significantly better stabilization of valvular GAGs. The overall aim of this project is extend the durability of BHVs well beyond 20 years. We are proposing to study BHV durability for up to 800 million cycles (25 years of valve functional life). Such long-term fatigue damage study is unprecedented in the BHV field. Thus we will test the following hypotheses.1) BHVs with improved extracellular matrix stabilization and ethanol pretreatment to prevent calcification will resist degeneration in vitro during extended flexural fatigue and after in vivo implantation. Our novel neomycin-based crosslinking procedure will be combined with clinically used ethanol anti-calcification pretreatment. a) GAG stability will be tested in vitro during storage and cyclic fatigue up to 800 million cycles (more than 25 years of functional life) and b) in vivo in a rat subdermal-implantation model. 2) BHVs with improved extracellular matrix stabilization and ethanol pretreatment for preventing calcification will have improved biomechanical function and enhanced long-term durability. The role of native GAGs in preserving the biomechanical performance of GLUT-crosslinked porcine aortic valve cusps will be studied in two major deformation modes associated with valve function: planar biaxial tension and flexure in presence or absence of GAGs. b) Cuspal biomechanical function during in vitro cyclic fatigue up to 800 million cycles (25 years of functional life) will be studied. 3) BHVs with improved extracellular matrix stabilization and ethanol pretreatment for preventing calcification will be endowed with improved biological durability. Degeneration and calcification of BHVs with GAG-targeted chemistry/GLUT/Ethanol will be compared with clinically used ethanol pretreated GLUT-fixed BHVs in a sheep mitral valve-replacement model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About 175000 patients need heart valve replacements due to damaged or dysfunctional valves. Bioprosthetic heart valves derived from chemically fixed pig heart valves are used frequently for this purpose. The majority of these valves fail after 5-15 years due to degeneration and calcification and need replacements again. This grant proposal is investigating new chemical fixatives that would improve functional life-time of these valves so that the valve could outlast the patient.      ","372187",

The classic inflammatory response in ulcerative colitis patients is limited to the mucosa and submucosa. Yet the colonic circular smooth muscle contractility is suppressed in these patients. The precise nature of the stimulus and the cellular mechanisms that suppress circular smooth muscle contractility in the absence of a clearly identified inflammatory response in the muscularis externa are not known. By contrast transmural inflammation occurs in Crohn's disease. The circular smooth muscle contractility is suppressed also in these patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that different inflammatory mediators and cellular mechanisms suppress colonic circular smooth muscle contractility in the two forms of IBD. We will test this hypothesis in two well-established and validated animal models of inflammation the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) - induced colonic inflammation that mimics the classic features of Crohn's disease and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) - induced colonic inflammation that mimics those of ulcerative colitis. Our specific aims are to investigate the: 1. Differential immune responses in the muscularis externa of the TNBS and DSS models and how the initial immune response in the mucosa sends the signal to the muscularis externa to initiate the immune response there.2. Cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the respective prominent inflammatory mediators in the muscularis externa of the TNBS and DSS models alter the expression of key cell signaling proteins in circular smooth muscle cells which suppresses their contractility.3. Cis-regulation of genes encoding the proteins whose suppression results in the reduction of cell contractility in the TNBS and DSS models of inflammation. The hypothesis that motility dysfunction due to the suppression of circular smooth muscle contractility may result from different cellular and molecular mechanisms is novel. Gut inflammation may occur due to a variety of bacterial viral and parasitic infections as well as due to food allergies and IBD. Colonic motility dysfunction is one of the major factors contributing to the common symptom of diarrhea in all types of inflammation. Our findings are expected to suggest that alternate therapeutic approaches may be required to normalize motility dysfunction in different types of inflammation. This situation is similar to that in the two forms of IBD; both of which develop inflammation but their therapeutic approaches are different because the nature of inflammatory responses in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients are different.

It is an emerging methodology which like comparative genomics provides a powerful tool for understanding cellular function. Network comparison has been used to identify the functional roles of many proteins and it offers insight into how mutations in the genome contribute to the evolution of new functions and phenotypes. A current hurdle towards these goals is the lack of high-coverage interaction maps at the appropriate evolutionary distances to enable network comparison.    To address this shortcoming the major goal of this project is to obtain matching sets of highdensity physical and genetic interaction maps across the model organisms Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Use of these data will ultimately help resolve the following questions: How closely do the architectures of the physical genetic and transcriptional interaction networks reflect variation in the underlying genomic sequence?; What relative contributions do changes in the physical interactome genetic pathways transcriptional networks and mutations at the protein sequence level make to the evolution of new cellular functions? Specific hypotheses directly related to the physiologies of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae can also be addressed. Many aspects of S. pombe physiology bear more in common with mammals than does S. cerevisiae including intron/exon splicing chromosomal architecture and RNA interference machinery. In fact the last common ancestor of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae is quite ancient (420 mya) making the conserved interaction map generalizable to large parts of the eukaryotic lineage. To focus our initial interaction mapping efforts on the regulatory machinery most likely to form the basis for the similarities and differences between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae physiology we will screen interactions among a targeted set of ~400 kinases and transcriptional regulators. This set will limit our scope sufficiently such that high coverage maps can be obtained at reasonable funding levels within a five-year time frame.    Pair-wise genetic interactions will be measured using epistatic phenotyping protein-protein interactions using affinity purification followed by tandem mass spectrometry and transcription factor / promoter binding interactions using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In parallel we will develop a companion suite of bioinformatic methods to perform integrative and comparative analysis of the yeast interaction networks. Bioinformatic research will address: [1] Models of interplay between quantitative genetic and physical interactions; [2] Alignment of the integrated networks across species; and [3] Prediction and transfer of interactions within and across species at varying degrees of data integration.    Assembling the network of transcriptional regulators and kinases will serve as a pilot for establishing basic principles of network integration and comparison prior to embarking on larger-scale efforts to comprehensively map fission yeast as well as higher eukaryotes.

In particular there is virtually no information about the treatment experiences of Latinas and the implications on return to work and quality of life into the survivorship period. Furthermore there are lingering concerns about disparities in outcomes related to paid work and quality of life for African American women. To address these issues we propose to perform a follow-up survey at 3 years after diagnosis of a cohort of 2498 patients diagnosed with breast cancer during a period from May 2005 to February 2007 and reported to the Los Angeles and Detroit SEER registries. We will examine racial/ethnic differences in disruption in paid work for patients with breast cancer into the survivorship period. We will also examine racial/ethnic differences in quality of life domains including financial stress for patients with breast cancer into the early survivorship period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from the study will inform health care policy and interventions to improve the quality of care for vulnerable patient populations.      ","539738",

Studies of human breast biopsies have implicated in this process cysteine cathepsins V/L2 and B in tumor cells and macrophages and cathepsins F K and L in myoepithelial cells/[myo]fibroblasts.  Aberrant signal transduction for example through p21-activated kinase 1 [PAK1] may contribute to increased pericellular proteolysis.  Our working hypothesis is that the transition from pre-invasive DCIS to invasive carcinomas and the rapid progression of some DCIS lesions are mediated through alterations in proteolytic pathways in DCIS cells and DCIS-associated cells and that dysregulated PAK1 contributes to the induction of these aberrant proteolytic pathways.  To test this hypothesis we will recapitulate the transition from pre-invasive DCIS to invasive carcinoma using in vitro and in vivo progression models that we have designated MAME for mammary architecture microenvironment engineering.  In these models we will use isogenic MCF10 cell lines [AT1 DCIS1 and CA1d] and two human DCIS cell lines [SUM-102 and SUM-225].  Our specific aims are to: 1. Modulate expression and activity of cysteine cathepsin V or B in the isogenic and SUM DCIS cell lines both by direct targeting and through intervention at the level of PAK1 and determine using the in vitro MAME model whether the invasive phenotype is altered; 2. Determine using the in vitro MAME model whether the invasive phenotype can be altered by co-culturing modified cells from Aim 1 with myoepithelial cells [myo]fibroblasts or both cell types using wild-type cells and ones in which expression and activity of cysteine cathepsin F K or L have been modulated; 3. Determine using the in vivo MAME model whether the malignant phenotype of xenografts of modified cells from Aim 1 can be altered by simultaneous implantation of myoepithelial cells [myo]fibroblasts or both cell types using wild-type cells and ones in which expression and activity of cysteine cathepsin F K or L have been modulated; and 4. Screen [via our Hu/Mu ProtIn chip] the in vivo MAME model for proteolytic pathways that may contribute to the transition from DCIS to IDC and use the in vitro MAME model to define functional changes with libraries of reagents from the Center on Proteolytic Pathways.  Validating in the context both of the tumor and its microenvironment proteases key to progression of DCIS to IDC and kinase pathways that regulate them should identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention as well as biomarkers to distinguish DCIS lesions that will rapidly progress to IDC.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Proteases and kinases are the subject of intensive efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop new treatment strategies for human diseases including cancer.  Our proposed studies will discover and validate protease pathways that are active in the tumor microenvironment and that mediate the transition to a full-blown malignancy and kinase pathways that regulate these protease pathways.  We anticipate that our studies will identify biomarkers to distinguish premalignant lesions that will progress to invasive cancers and define targets that will abrogate that progression.      ","310340",

Non-invasive imaging techniques are currently available for visualizing different pathological conditions of the human body but their use for cancer monitoring is limited due to the lack of tumor-specific imaging probes. We have previously developed a multi-modal imaging probe (MN-EPPT) targeting the underglycosylated mucin-1 tumor antigen (uMUC-1) which is overexpressed and underglycosylated on over 90% of breast tumors and whose expression is tightly linked to tumor progression from pre-malignancy to advanced malignancy as well as to tumor response to chemotherapy. In the past we have shown that MN-EPPT is highly specific for uMUC-1 antigen and demonstrated its potential both for tumor detection in a variety of tumor models and for the tracking of change in tumor size following chemotherapy in a pre-clinical pancreatic cancer model. Our preliminary results extend these findings even further by defining a method for the simultaneous quantitative assessment of tumor volume and target antigen availability in breast tumors before and after chemotherapy. In this application we propose to investigate the differential accumulation of MN-EPPT in human breast lesions at different stages of carcinogenesis as a function of uMUC-1 availability and to utilize this differential accumulation in order to noninvasively and quantitatively monitor the progression of the tumor from pre- malignancy to early malignancy and finally to advanced malignancy. We will monitor two parameters of tumor progression: 1. change in tumor volume based on the tumor-selective uptake of the targeted probe which can be used for tumor delineation and 2. change in uMUC-1 antigen availability based on the specificity of MN- EPPT for the uMUC-1 antigen and expressed as differences in the amount of probe taken up by the tumor. Finally we will evaluate change in tumor size and uMUC-1 expression during the course of conventional chemotherapy and correlate them with tumor progression/regression along the continuum from early to advanced malignancy. If successful this study can further be translated into clinical applications since related iron oxides have already been tested in clinical trials.       ","616625",

Physiological responses to estrogen include the regulation of mammalian reproduction and breast function central nervous and immune systems skeletal physiology and vascular function. We have recently described novel functions of the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30. This receptor is activated by both agonists and antagonists of the classical estrogen receptors ER1 and ER2. Until recently there were no known specific ligands for GPR30 making traditional pharmacological approaches to the study of this receptor difficult. Our recent studies however have combined both virtual and biomolecular screening to discover the first GPR30-selective agonist G-1. The specific aims of this application are: 1. Perform a combination of virtual and biomolecular screening to identify additional GPR30-specific ligands based on compounds presently known to bind and activate GPR30. Structure-activity analyses will be carried out to determine the critical molecular determinants for GPR30 binding selectivity and activity as compared to classical estrogen receptors. 2. Based on the biomolecular screening results and structure-activity analyses of Aim 1 rationally design and synthesize small libraries (up to 20 compounds per cycle) of novel G-1-based ligands. The goal of this aim is to separate agonism from antagonism within ligands and to further evaluate the SAR of novel GPR30 ligands through targeted synthetic chemistry. 3. Characterize the biological functions of the compounds identified and synthesized in Aims 1 and 2. A collection of functional bioassays will be employed to characterize the biological effects of the compounds displaying activity. These assays will include intracellular signaling assays such as calcium mobilization ERK and EGFR phosphorylation and PI3K activation; more complex cellular assays such as transcriptional activation cell migration and proliferation; and in vivo studies using mouse models. Understanding the pharmacological profile and structure-activity relationships for ligand binding to GPR30 will be critical to the discovery of novel drugs that target this receptor for the purposes of revealing the underlying physiology of the receptor and developing therapeutic approaches for the improved treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Estrogen plays an important role in normal and disease biology. We have characterized a novel membrane estrogen receptor that likely plays a role in estrogen biology.

The generation of proteome-wide interactome network maps with high specificity and high sensitivity is a necessary although not sufficient aspect in the quest of generating predictive macromolecular models at the scale of the whole cell. Moreover these maps serve as a foundation for mechanistic and quantitative studies of poorly characterized predicted gene products and disease-associated proteins. There are two major approaches to experimentally map the protein-protein interactome network of any organism of interest: i) all pairwise combinations of pairs of predicted proteins can be experimentally tested to derive all possible binary physical interactions (binary interactome); and ii) all proteins can be tested to interrogate in which protein complex(es) they belong (co-complex interactome). It is well established that binary and co-complex approaches are complementary in providing increasingly accurate and complete interactome models. We propose to continue our efforts at systematically mapping the human binary interactome with the goal of generating and analyzing a new version of HT-Y2H interactions with high quality and high sensitivity for all pairwise combinations of predicted gene products for which we have at least one Gateway-cloned ORF available. This corresponds to a matrix of ~16000 X 16000 proteins which represents ~50% of the complete matrix since we assume a total of ~22000 protein-coding genes and limit the analysis to a single splice variant per gene.    Our modified specific aims are to:  i) Provide an expanded high-confidence/high-coverage version of the human binary interactome map  ii) Validate human binary interaction data  iii) Analyze the expanded human interactome model      ","1800000",

Millions of patients suffer loss of salivary gland function due to Sj""gren's syndrome or radiation therapy. Understanding the differentiation of salivary cells is a necessary step to enable the restoration of diseased or destroyed parotid salivary tissue. Previous work has described terminal differentiation of acinar cells histologically and by characterizing the expression of markers of differentiation but has not used genomics-level approaches or mathematical models to define regulatory pathways. The primary goal of the current application is to develop formal mathematical and statistical models that will identify networks which cause terminal differentiation of parotid acinar cells. The dynamic mathematical models will serve to generate hypotheses which will be tested and the model will be repeatedly refined by the incorporation of new data. This application is in response to the RFA ""A Systems Approach to Salivary Gland Biology."" Our overall hypothesis for these studies is that a mathematical model can identify key regulatory pathways that control parotid acinar cell differentiation. Specific Aim 1 will use Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) to obtain RNA from embryonic and newborn rat parotid acinar cells for microarray analysis of the patterns of gene expression across the period of differentiation. A coupled Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model will be created to describe the hypothetical interactions that direct the process of differentiation. The hypotheses will be tested and the ODE model refined by a combination of RT-PCR IHC and Western blots. Since microRNAs are important regulators of development Specific Aim 2 will define the expression of microRNAs in acinar cells and the pattern of changes during differentiation. There are currently no publications describing microRNAs in the parotid tissue. The results will be used to revise the mathematical model of differentiation. Specific Aim 3 will create a statistical algorithm to validate and revise the ODE model by defining the sources of bias and variation as well as by assessing the model's predictive power overall and in its various sub-modules. This will allow confidence intervals to be associated with different pathways within the ODE model. Specific Aim 4 will use the ODE model to make hypotheses about specific pathways regulating gene expression in the parotid acinar cells. These hypotheses will be tested by transfection and transduction experiments and the results shall be used to refine and validate the mathematical model. This systems biology approach should identify molecular pathways that drive cytodifferentiation of parotid acinar cells. Project Narrative: The overall goal of this research is to define the molecular mechanisms which control differentiation of cells into secretory salivary acinar cells. This addresses the needs of millions of Americans who suffer from salivary gland dysfunction due to Sj""gren's Syndrome radiation therapy or xerostomia due to essential medications. This research is a necessary foundation for developing new technologies such as gene transfer therapy and biologics for treating or alleviating the oral symptoms of xerostomia.      ","383852",

It is estimated that up to 20% of adults in the US will suffer from xerostomia. The morbidity of this chronic condition is very high leading in extreme cases to malnourishment. The decreased ability to produce adequate levels of saliva has been associated with numerous subjective and objective functional deficits including the sensation of oral dryness (xerostomia); difficulty with speaking mastication and swallowing; and an increased susceptibility to caries development and opportunistic infections (e.g. Candida albicans). Treatments are often only partially effective frequently producing adverse side-effects and usually requiring life-long use. An important first step in improving these treatments is a thorough understanding of the molecular pathways involved in secretion. While substantial advances have been made in our understanding of exocrine gland function and regulation there remain significant gaps in our knowledge. In particular we have not yet achieved a clear picture of the synergisms required among signaling pathways and effector molecules to modulate fluid production from salivary glands. We shall address this problem using a multi-scale mathematical and computational model. Unlike purely experimental work such mathematical models are able to provide an overall understanding of how the behavior of a complex system depends on the behaviors of its constituent elements. Initially we shall develop models of individual parotid acinar and duct cells and couple these models into a large-scale model of a prototypical secretory unit of a single acinus and associated duct. The model will then be validated and tested against a large set of existing experimental results and will be used to develop further experiments to test hypotheses about salivary gland function and regulation. In particular we will examine how intercellular coupling affects salivary secretion how secretion depends on the spatial positioning and functioning of the various ion channels and how oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration affect saliva secretion. Project Narrative: Salivary gland dysfunction is a problem for millions of people with a significant impact on their quality of life. Although some treatments exist development of improved therapies is hampered by our limited understanding of exactly how saliva secretion is controlled. We shall combine experimental investigations with a computational model to study the mechanisms of saliva secretion and control and use this model to guide additional experiments.      ","729736",

Existing strategies for engineering salivary glands have been unable to create a complex branched structure or successfully produce saliva-secreting acinar cells which may relate to the lack of appropriate 3D structure in these models. Although there is currently a clinical need for artificial salivary glands to replace the damaged saliva-producing tissue in patients suffering from Sj""gren's Syndrome or from side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck tumors few predictive tools are available to model cell behavior. To engineer branched tissues we need to understand how the branching occurs during development and how signaling pathways translate into physical changes. While many signaling pathways and structural components have been identified that play a role in branching they so far have not been incorporated into a comprehensive integrated model that explains branching morphogenesis. This highly dynamic structural process can hardly be understood using conventional molecular biology methods alone. Only a close association between experiments and mathematical modeling will allow an integrated systems level understanding of the process of branching morphogenesis. We previously generated a simulation framework to model lung branching based on localized proliferation. This model is limited since basement membrane dynamics are critical for branching. Our hypothesis is that basement membrane dynamics controlled by Rho kinase (ROCK)-mediated signaling is a critical component of salivary gland branching morphogenesis. To address this hypothesis and to create a framework for understanding the role of basement membrane dynamics during branching morphogenesis we propose five specific aims: Specific Aim 1 Develop a simulation framework for salivary gland branching morphogenesis based on Level Set Methods Specific Aim 2 Develop the experimental model system and compare experimental results with predictions of the new mathematical model and simulation framework Specific Aim 3 Investigate the function of cytoskeletal inhibitors on branching morphogenesis and use this data to train the model Specific Aim 4 Determine if ROCK inhibitors affect cytoskeletal tension during branching morphogenesis and Specific Aim 5 Identify the cellular mechanism by which ROCK affects branching morphogenesis. The robust simulation framework and the mathematical models developed as a result of this project will constitute the first crucial step towards development of a comprehensive model of salivary gland branching morphogenesis. Significantly it will guide experimentalists by revealing missing links and suggesting directions for future research. Further the mathematical model and simulation framework can be modified as more data is obtained and will provide us with a tool to predict and eventually control cell behavior on different matrix substrates for intelligent engineering of a functional salivary gland. Project Narrative: The data obtained from this grant will advance basic scientific knowledge regarding the role of the basement membrane in control of branching morphogenesis in the salivary gland. In addition we will create a mathematical model that incorporates experimental analysis of both biochemical and physical control. The model will be implemented in an appropriate numerical framework. This software tool will be accessible by a front end user-friendly interface such that it will be available for other experimental biologists to use as a research tool for testing hypothesis in silico before experimenting with live tissue. Finally in generating this model that allows us to describe and predict cell behavior within this context we will gain insights into new methods for controlling cells for engineering of tissues which require prediction of cell behavior. This work will lead to generation of new models for tissue engineering.      ","319793",

The biomarker candidates were validated on biopsy specimens obtained from a population-based cohort of women diagnosed with DCIS treated by lumpectomy alone and followed for twenty years [2]. These markers identify a highly aggressive pre-malignant subtype that we call ""basal-like"" ductal carcinoma in situ (B-L DCIS) in this application since it shares markers specific to basal-like invasive tumors. In this application we hypothesize that by identifying additional functional cellular and molecular characteristics of this very aggressive basal-like pre-malignant subtype (B-L DCIS) we will be able to (a) refine their classification for risk of progression to invasive tumors and (b) develop clinically useful probes for non-invasive imaging to track these high-risk lesions in vivo. In preparation for these studies we have discovered a number of processes and potential surface epitopes specific to basal-like invasive tumors and shared with B-L DCIS and PRIMED cells. Importantly we believe that the development of non-invasive imaging of B-L DCIS and the ability to interrogate pre-malignant cells in vivo may give us insights into the biology and risk factors critical to tumor initiation and progression a new approach to non-invasively detect aggressive pre-malignancy in human breast cancer and the ability to monitor its' evolution as it progresses to invasive disease. We have assembled an integrated team of basic and clinical scientists to (Specific Aim 1) identify candidate prognostic markers and functions and (Specific Aims 2-4) develop non-invasive imaging of basal-like pre-malignant lesions with high risk for future invasive tumor formation. We will: Specific Aim 1: Identify distinctive surface epitopes for human mammary epithelial and stromal cells found in B-L DCIS and characterize functional alterations that predict progression to malignancy. Specific Aim 2: Validate the efficacy and specificity of cell surface targets in vitro and in vivo using optical imaging. Specific Aim 3: Develop clinical imaging agents for detection of B-L DCIS in breast tissue. Specific Aim 4: Develop and apply functional imaging to identify basal-like pre-malignancies (B-L DCIS) that are associated with future formation of invasive tumors. These studies will generate the identification of cellular processes and molecular biomarkers that predict future invasive tumors events years before they occur. Collaboration between stromal signals and epithelial responses at the earliest stages of pre-malignancy will be elucidated. Application of these markers will allow for risk stratification of women diagnosed with DCIS and potential targets for preventive agents. Development of selected markers as tools for non-invasive imaging will open an unprecedented avenue to study early aggressive pre-malignancies and risk factors that contribute to their progression.        ","666024",

The final system is intended to provide a relatively high quality sequence from =6.5-fold coverage of a genome using DNA from fewer than 1 million cells with no amplification or labeling. The specific aims are: 1) Characterize ungapped nanotube articulated nanopore detectors in ionic solution with and without DNA molecules to establish a device model; 2) Control ssDNA binding translocation and sliding on the nanotube surface exposed in ungapped nanotube articulated nanopores; 3) Study and optimize DNA molecule induced field effect modulation of nanotube electrode conductance in ungapped nanotube articulated nanopores as a function of nanotube bias gate voltage and solution properties; 4) Analyze and optimize tunneling current modulations between gapped nanotube electrodes in the first generation detector; 5) Design and fabricate a second generation detector with embedded 'T' nanotube geometry and achieve 1 Kb/sec sequencing on Kb length strands of DNA; 6) Design a third generation nanopore detector for high throughput 10 Kb/sec/nanopore sequencing.

One of the most effective treatments for OCD is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) yet we do not really know how CBT works in the brain. The long-term objective of this proposal is to use neuroimaging to understand what parts of the brain are affected by CBT and which of the chemical systems of the brain are involved. Such knowledge may help clinicians identify which patients are better to treat with drugs and which with CBT. This is highly relevant to the NIH mission to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. This proposal will use the noninvasive neuroimaging technique of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI). MRSI measures the concentrations of several neurometabolites in multiple brain regions simultaneously. The metabolites glutamate and glutamine (measured together and abbreviated as ""Glx"") are particularly important for neurotransmission and cell energy requirements and are suspected to be disturbed in OCD. This proposal will focus on a network of brain structures called the ""emotion-anxiety depression circuit"". In OCD patients dysfunction is suspected in several structures comprising this circuit. In this proposal MRSI scans will be performed twice on each of 30 children or adolescents with OCD once before and once after a course of 12 weekly sessions of CBT. They will be compared to a second group of 30 healthy control children and adolescents who receive no treatment scanned before and after a comparable time interval. A third group of 30 OCD children and adolescents will be scanned before and after 8 weeks while they are simply waiting for treatment on our clinical treatment waitlist. After their 8 weeks are up they too will receive CBT and will be scanned a third time after the 12 weekly sessions are done. All groups will also undergo clinical and neurocognitive testing at each time point. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Determine if levels of the metabolite Glx in the emotion-anxiety depression circuit differ between OCD patients and controls; 2) Determine levels of Glx in the circuit change after CBT and after waitlist in the OCD patients and if they change after simple passage of time in the controls; 3) Determine if there is a relationship between changes in scores on neurocognitive testing and changes in Glx levels in the three groups before and after CBT or before and after simply waiting. If successful this proposal will establish whether Glx levels in the emotion-anxiety depression circuit are abnormal in untreated children with OCD and whether these levels change in response to CBT. If the latter is true that will help neuroscientists and clinicians determine where in the brain CBT has its effects. Such data may be relevant to future efforts to improve OCD treatment and individual treatment matching. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but even with the best available treatment most patients enjoy only partial recovery and many patients do not respond adequately at all. Such incomplete and inadequate response contributes to greater public health costs in terms of morbidity and patient care expenses. This proposal aims for a better understanding of the brain mechanisms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in order to develop novel therapies and improve the success of existing therapies.      ","518275",

Although SCH does not present with symptoms of clinical hypothyroidism it may be associated with mood cognitive and physical symptoms and increased risk for hyperlipidemia and ischemic heart disease. SCH may also increase vulnerability to depression cognitive impairment and dementia. SCH is relatively common and occurs in approximately five to ten percent of the population with higher prevalence (up to 20%) in women over age 60. To date there have been no well designed controlled studies that have evaluated the neuropsychiatric effects of SCH on the most vulnerable population (i.e. elderly individuals) and the impact of thyroid hormone treatment in this group despite the well documented association between thyroid dysfunction and mood and cognitive disturbance. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate depression and neuropsychological function in non-demented elderly individuals with SCH and the efficacy of T4 treatment in improving mood and cognition in these subjects. There are two phases to the proposed study. In phase I we will employ a cross- sectional design to evaluate the specific nature severity and pattern of mood cognitive and physical symptoms in elderly non-demented participants with SCH compared with euthyroid controls. In the second phase we will carry out a double-blind placebo- controlled sixteen week study of the effect of T4 in improving these measures in the SCH subjects. Mood cognition quality of life physical symptoms of hypothyroidism and thyroid status (T4 T3 TSH and antithyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies) will be measured. This study will yield important information about the neuropsychiatric effects of SCH on a vulnerable population and the effect of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing symptoms and improving overall functioning. Public Health Relevance: This project aims to determine whether there are specific alterations of mood and cognition with mild thyroid failure also known as subclinical hypothyroidism. Furthermore this research will also address whether alterations of mood and cognition associated with subclinical hypothyroidism are improved with thyroid hormone treatment.      ","544440",

The two main paradigms to explain emphysema postulate a) an imbalance of protease/antiproteases triggered by inflammation and b) a state of excessive alveolar endothelial apoptosis causing capillary regression. These two mechanisms would explain the loss of alveolar wall characterizing emphysema. However the coexistence of an excessive lung structural cell apoptosis with that of an activated inflammatory state in emphysema and the hierarchy of their interaction have not yet been explained. We propose the excess of endothelial-monocyte-activating protein (EMAP II) is a unifying molecular mechanism to link apoptosis and inflammation in emphysema. EMAP II is a cytokine induced by conditions present in emphysematous lungs being released from cells upon proteolytic cleavage by caspases and matrix metalloproteinases which are known to participate in COPD. We identified CXCR3 as a functional receptor for EMAP II which mediates EMAP II-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and monocyte activation. Given the potent pro-apoptotic effect of EMAP II on endothelial cells coupled with its ability to activate and recruit pro-inflammatory monocytes we hypothesize that excessive EMAP II release in response to cigarette smoking engages both lung endothelial cell apoptosis and monocyte inflammatory activation and therefore is a key molecular mediator of emphysema. We postulate that smoke induces EMAP II which causes CXCR3- dependent endothelial apoptosis and activates monocytes. Activated caspases and matrix metalloproteinases may further increase EMAP II in the lung amplifying damage signals that culminate in emphysema. These studies are relevant to human emphysema as we measured increased EMAP II in the lungs of emphysema patients. Indeed our data indicate that smoke-induced emphysema is preceded by EMAP II production and apoptosis in mice and lung-specific EMAP II increases are sufficient to cause lung apoptosis and emphysema. We will test the function of the secreted EMAP II and its receptor by neutralizing antibodies in cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in mice and conditional EMAP II transgenic overexpression in the lung. We developed 3 specific aims: 1. To determine whether EMAP II is a biomarker and molecular mediator of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema. 2 To investigate whether excessive lung EMAP II induces emphysema by triggering lung endothelial cell apoptosis or by recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and 3. To determine the mechanism of EMAP II-induced cell apoptosis in primary human endothelial lung cells. These aims if achieved are expected to position EMAP II as a therapeutic target and/or biomarker of emphysema. PROJECT NARRATIVE: We propose that our experimental plan will allow us to identify a key player in emphysema; EMAP II which may become a biomarker measurable in biological fluids and may also prove to be an attractive pharmacological target in a disease with scarce therapeutical options and a high morbidity and mortality. The excessive EMAP II release stimulated by cellular stresses and ongoing protease activation would account for a vicious and worth targeting cycle of alveolar destruction in the lung. Furthermore our work will allow to refine mechanisms of endothelial cell apoptosis while unifying the two theories in the field that of excessive inflammation with that of excessive apoptosis.      ","368800",

Although significant advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms by which these molecules are biosynthesized very little is known about how they transduce signals to trigger a physiological response. NO mediates its physiological actions via its heme protein receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Despite three decades of research the structural basis of how NO binding to sGC activates second messenger (cGMP) production is not understood. We have devised innovative strategies to gain insights into this process. This includes our discovery of a novel family of bacterial NO sensors (SONO) that share remarkable sequence identity with the sensor domain of sGC. Although the signal for SONO has remained unchanged during two billion years of evolution its function is unrelated to cGMP biosynthesis. The SONO-protein interactions we have identified has allowed us to frame the provocative hypothesis that the NO sensor is a promiscuous molecular switch capable of triggering functionally unrelated signaling events via a limited set of structural changes. Four specific aims have been designed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1. What is the structure of NO- and CO-activated SONO? Aim 2: What are the structural bases of heme- and NO-independent signaling by human sGC? Aim 3: How is NO and activator binding coupled to sGC catalysis? Aim 4: What is the molecular mechanism by which SONO mediates chemotaxis in human pathogens? The proposed research will provide novel insights into mechanisms of gaseous messenger signaling. It will also pave the way for rational strategies aimed at developing therapeutic interventions for cardiovascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among the several functions of nitric oxide - a gas produced by the cells lining our blood vessels - is its ability to convert sexual excitement into erections in males. This proposal is aimed at understanding how nitric oxide works in healthy and disease states.      ","292042",

Our group has taken the approach of first developing a detailed understanding of the native tissue's structure-function relationships by integrating sophisticated and rigorous mechanical testing with mathematical modeling. Fiber-reinforced scaffolds are key components to achieve TEC mechanical design requirements and influence tissue growth. Our group uses aligned electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds to prescribe mechanical properties and tissue architecture to enhance structure-function properties over time in culture. In the following Aims we combine our expertise in tissue mechanics mathematical modeling fabrication of aligned nanofibrous scaffolds and tissue engineering with standard measures of biochemistry and histology to generate functional load-bearing fiber-reinforced tissue equivalents. Aim 1: Quantify native human AF tissue structure-function under complex loading to establish the TEC design requirements. Aim 2: Create a single layer TEC from an aligned electrospun nanofibrous scaffold seeded with AF cells. Aim 3: Create a planar stacked TEC from pre-seeded nanofibrous scaffolds with alternating fiber orientation in each layer to mimic native AF architecture. This study will achieve a functional tissue engineered AF with the ultimate goal of fabricating a full structural engineered disc and clinical implementation as a total disc implant. Innovations include our approach to functional tissue engineering focusing first on benchmark TEC mechanics and using constitutive modeling to set design criteria. Our aligned nanofibrous scaffold and our `layered' approach mimicking the native AF tissue structure are also innovative. Notably this design approach for load-bearing fiber-reinforced tissues focusing on mechanics first can be extended to other orthopaedic and cardiovascular tissue applications.

The focus of this study is genes that dysregulate glucose homeostasis by impairing insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This dysregulation results in diabetes and other common disorders. Molecular genetics and functional biology individually have great strengths but also countervailing limitations. Importantly these strengths and weaknesses are cross-compensating. We propose to combine the strengths to develop an integrated system for gene discovery. This will be achieved by testing this integration strategy in two different scenarios faced by investigators searching for genes that contribute to human disorders. In Aim 1 there is extensive molecular genetic evidence for genes contributing to acute insulin response and disposition index on chromosome 11q in the IRAS Family Study but to date we have no complementary functional biology studies. We will use RNAi technology to systematically knock down genes prioritized from prior molecular genetic analysis to identify candidates for involvement in acute insulin response and disposition index. In Aim 2 we will use the knock down technology to assess genes identified by Genome Wide Association analysis in the IRASFS. In this Aim we will knock down H150 genes which have identified in GWAS analysis of acute insulin response insulin resistance and disposition index using various knockdown models. Aim 3 will expand the molecular genetic and functional analysis on the subset of genes identified in Aims 1 to 3. This will include intense resequencing of genes and functionally assessing specific alleles or combinations of alleles. The goals of this study are both the scientific identification of genes important in glucose homeostasis and diabetes and second the technical demonstration that integrated molecular genetic and functional analysis can be translated into substantial savings in time labor and materials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to integrate the use of two technologies molecular genetics and functional analysis to accelerate the identification of genes contributing to insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta cell function.        ","447936",

While mechanical conditions such as these appear to influence healing of skeletal tissues there is only an incomplete understanding of the key physical factors and underlying mechanisms that influence cell fate decisions at the bone-implant interface. As a result there is a limited scientific basis for the design of load-bearing implants for use in skeletal tissues. Our working hypothesis is that deformation in healing tissue as defined by principal strain magnitude spatial extent and related factors regulates cell fate decisions at the bone-implant interface. The proposed work will test this hypothesis in a mouse model using a miniature implant device that permits control and quantification of the biomechanical environment (i.e. the strain state) of the healing bone-implant interface and which allows us to measure the cellular response to different mechanical stimuli using molecular cellular and genetic approaches. Aim 1 will examine how variations in strain magnitude spatial extent and number of strain cycles per day influence mechanobiology at the healing bone-implant interface. Our miniature device and implant design allows us to create situations where either principal compressive strain is the dominant type of strain or principal tensile strain is the dominant type of strain. Strain will be measured using micro-CT and digital image correlation then correlated in time and space with the in vivo cellular response. Together these experimental results will allow us to identify regimes of ""safe"" ""dangerous"" or ""stimulatory"" principal tensile or compressive strain. Aim 2 will explore how cells at a healing interface detect and decipher physical stimuli such as strain. Primary cilia are implicated in fetal bone mechanotransduction; we hypothesize that primary cilia are required for implant mechanotransduction. We will test this hypothesis by conditionally inactivating an essential component of the primary cilium molecular machinery Kif3a and measuring how this alters response to strain state and healing of the bone-implant interface. Aim 3 will test whether biomechanical strain operates at multiscale levels (macro micro and nano) to influence cell differentiation at implant interfaces. We hypothesize that an implant's surface texture (roughness) can influence local strain fields at the same size scale e.g. microns. This will be tested by subjecting implants with differing surface textures to micromotions that are of the same size as the roughness. Overall this project will contribute scientific insight that can guide design decisions with skeletal implants.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Loosening and failure of load-bearing bone implants remain a major health problem. In order to help solve this problem this project is trying to understand why certain mechanical conditions at the bone-implant interface are dangerous to the healing processes while others are safe and sometimes even beneficial to healing. Our work focuses on the role of deformation of healing tissues; the ways that living cells sense that deformation; and the ways that an implant's overall shape as well as its surface roughness can be better designed to take advantage of this knowledge.      ","609485",

Among African-Americans with LN standard therapy prevents renal failure in only 50 percent of patients over five years compared to 85 percent among Caucasians. Adjunctive therapies that are targeted towards mediators of this aggressive LN phenotype are needed to resolve this disparity. LN is characterized by autoantibody production glomerular immune complex deposition and in the case of proliferative disease complement activation and subsequent innate immune response. An essential arm of the innate immune response is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI or RONI). We have described increased production of RNI in human SLE most noticeably among African-Americans and those with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). These observations were made using a marker of RNI production that is influenced by diet making it a potentially less useful clinical biomarker of disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevents murine LN without affecting autoantibody production or complement activation suggesting that the effect of NOS on glomerular inflammation is distal to complement activation. However ablation of the inducible NOS gene in a murine lupus model does not prevent renal disease suggesting that iNOS is not the only enzyme affected by NOS inhibitors that is required for disease. The identity and tissue expression of other RONI-producing enzymes and the mechanisms through which their activity leads to increased glomerular inflammation have not been well characterized. Our overarching hypothesis is that reactive intermediate production is pathogenic in the progression of lupus nephritis. To address the above noted gaps in knowledge reactive intermediates responsible for pathology must be identified the location and identity of enzymes producing pathogenic RONI must be determined and methods for targeting pathogenic RONI must be tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the association between a novel set of biomarkers of reactive intermediate production and disease type and response to therapy in human lupus nephritis 2) Determine the effect of targeted genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of reactive intermediate production on LN in MRL/lpr mice and 3) Determine the effect of RONI production on MRL/lpr innate immune response and spleen T cell activation. The ultimate goal of the application is to define RONI useful as disease biomarkers and targets for therapy. The specific aims will further characterize both enzyme and RI targets for such an approach.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in up to 1/200 young black women. We have shown previously that reactive intermediates like nitric oxide are overproduced in lupus. The proposed research targeting these intermediates will potentially identify new biomarkers of disease and identify potential new targets for disease.      ","302164",

With the recent completion of the International HapMap Project the development of largescale genotyping technology and rapid decline in genotyping costs an immense amount of genotype data have been generated which in turn raises many new challenging problems for analysis and interpretation of the data. This application proposes developing new statistical methodologies that aim to address a wide range of statistical issues in current candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWA) studies.     Specifically the proposal will address the following problems. (1) Recent high-resolution genome mapping indicates that copy number variations (CNVs) are ubiquitous and common in the general population and may play a major role in phenotypic variation. In Aim 1 we will develop a Bayesian hidden Markov model based algorithm for highresolution CNV detection using whole-genome SNP genotyping data. Our algorithm has the ability to incorporate both unrelated individuals and family data. (2) Given the high density of genetic markers in largescale candidate gene and GWA studies it is reasonable to expect that multilocus genotypes offer more information on genetic association than single-marker analysis. In Aim 2 we will develop a powerful multimarker test for gene-based association analysis and extend the method to analysis of gene-gene interactions. The virtue of our method lies in its ability to borrow strength from nearby markers while reducing the degrees of freedom. (3) In many disease gene-mapping studies individuals are ascertained from a recently admixed population. In Aim 3 we will develop novel association tests in genetics studies using recently admixed populations. By considering ancestry level and genotypes together our method offers higher resolution and power than traditional admixture mapping methods. (4) Appropriate adjustment for multiple dependent tests has long been a problem in genetics studies especially for studies with limited sample size and without replication datasets. In Aim 4 we propose new methods to estimate the effective number of tests that reflect the amount of independent information contained in the data. (5) In Aim 5 we will develop test distribute and support freely available implementations of the methods proposed in this application. The methods will be evaluated through analytical approaches computer simulations and applications to multiple real datasets.     Recent development of large-scale genotyping technologies has led to the generation of an immense amount of genotype data which raises many new challenging problems for the analysis and interpretation of the data. This application proposes developing new statistical methodologies that address a set of unresolved issues.           ","402542",

Although clinical trials have demonstrated convincing survival benefits conferred by implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in selected patients with left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) less than 35% and congestive heart failure the overwhelming majority of patients who suffer a cardiac arrest will have an LVEF> 0.35. This grant application ""PRE-DETERMINE: Biologic Markers and MRI SCD Cohort Study"" seeks to identify patients at a substantially higher risk of arrhythmic death among CHD patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF>35%). The application takes advantage of a planned randomized trial the Defibrillators To Reduce Risk by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluation (DETERMINE) trial sponsored by St. Jude Medical to assemble a unique prospective cohort of patients who do not presently have an indication for ICD therapy based upon left ventricular function. The additional support from the NHLBI will provide a unique and timely opportunity to take advantage of the assembly of patients screened for the trial who will have contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) scans to create an invaluable cohort of 5300 patients with preserved LVEFs where the underlying cardiac substrate is well-defined by MRI imaging and where clinical information lifestyle habits electrocardiograms and blood samples will be collected at baseline and sudden arrhythmic events will be documented over the follow-up period. In years 4-5 the predictive value of promising protein genetic and metabolic biomarkers in combination with advanced substrate imaging on the risk of arrhythmic events will be examined in the 6850 patients enrolled in both the observational PRE-DETERMINE cohort and in the parent DETERMINE randomized trial. The goal is to arrive at a series of markers that alone or in combination specifically predict risk of arrhythmic death as compared to other causes of mortality among this at risk population of CHD patients. If biomarkers or genetic markers are identified that can specifically predict risk of ventricular arrhythmias then these markers may serve as relatively inexpensive methods to identify those at risk.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of identifying markers could be quite substantial leading to more efficient utilization of ICDs and advances in our understanding of mechanisms underlying SCD. The goal of this application is to improve our ability to identify patients who will die suddenly from coronary heart disease through the study of genes and blood markers. If these markers can predict risk of dying suddenly then they may serve as relatively inexpensive methods to identify those patients at risk. The public health impact of identifying such markers could be quite substantial leading to more efficient utilization of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and advances in our understanding of mechanisms underlying life-threatening rhythm disturbances.        ","1392367",

This cross-site Vanderbilt- Miami project will examine the extent to which early impairments in specific attentional and affective mechanisms - both of which are putative core deficits of autism - explain the behavioral heterogeneity that is observed in these high-risk children. We focus specifically on the domains of attention coordination and positive affective competencies and examine their development across the first two years of postnatal life (i.e. from 6 to 18 months) and their relation to later social and communicative outcomes at age 24 and 36 months. The overarching hypotheses are that there will be developmental continuity in these domains across the first two years that early differences in these domains will be evident between groups at high- and low-risk for ASD and that early impairments will predict individual differences in social and communicative outcomes observed in later-born ASD siblings. Specific areas of investigation include the relation between positive affective competencies in dyadic and triadic contexts across the first year of life the contributions of early positive affective competencies and attention coordination to the emergence of positive joint attention competencies in the second year of life and the extent to which individual differences in early positive affective competencies and attention coordination contribute to later autism symptomatology. This prospective longitudinal project will compare developmental trajectories and outcomes in 200 infant siblings of children diagnosed with ASD (Sib-ASD) and 100 infant siblings of typically developing children (Sib-TD). A split panel longitudinal design will allow us to examine development both within- and across- age-group cohorts from 6 months to 36 months of age. This project employs novel methods and measurement of infant behavior including electrophysiological and eye tracking measures measures of positive affect communication and representation and longitudinal measures of sharing positive emotion about objects with others. Longitudinal structural equation modeling and mixed modeling procedures are utilized to assess differences in the development of typically developing and at- risk siblings and to predict heterogeneity in the outcomes of the at-risk siblings of children with ASD. The project employs a developmental psychopathology perspective to shed light on normative and disturbed longitudinal pathways toward heterogenous outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prospective study of younger siblings of children with ASD offers an ideal opportunity to learn about the earliest signs of autism as well as the development manifestation and boundaries of the broader autism phenotype. This information is critical for understanding the causes of autism and for developing more effective and targeted treatments.      ","620838",

Approximately 10.4 million or 4.3% of the US population have used MA at some time in their lives. Also 6.2% of high school students are reported using MA at some point in their lives. In South Korea MA abuse has been the most prevalent form of drug abuse for many decades. Structural neurochemical and functional brain imaging studies in adult MA users reported neurobiological deficits in the prefrontal cortex and its potential recovery with abstinence. In contrast MA exposure in adolescence may impair the normal maturation and pruning of the prefrontal cortex depending on specific times of the exposure. Our pilot data indicates that adolescent MA abusers (13-18 years old) have a thinning in the prefrontal gray matter and that this deficit correlated inversely with age of onset. In the current proposal we will conduct a longitudinal follow-up study baseline 6-month and 24-month for early and late onset adolescent MA users using brain magnetic resonance imaging scans for cortical thickness analysis diffusion tensor imaging for assessing white matter integrity and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for quantifying neuronal viability. Our longitudinal design is likely to provide the information on the 'fixed progressive or resilient course from MA-induced neurotoxicities' and 'MA effects on the developing brain.' Second this multimodal imaging design will provide in-depth knowledge of MA-induced structural and functional brain deficits. Third the combination of longitudinal and multimodal imaging design provides the information the MA's influence on developmental trajectories of the brain. Our main research hypotheses are 1) MA dependent adolescents will have prefrontal deficits relative to controls 2) early-onset adolescent MA users will have greater prefrontal deficits than late-onset one and 3) recovery from abstinence will be only observed in the early-onset but not in the late-onset MA abusers. Exploratory analyses will also assess 1) the association between MA-induced neurotoxicities and neuropsychological dysfunction and 2) the potential combined effects of HIV and MA on the developing brain. We believe that this research proposal is strongly responsive to the International Research Collaboration on Drug Addiction in Program Announcement (PA-07-275) that encourages utilization of unique opportunities that exist abroad and places emphasis on securing foreign matching funds. As is also acknowledged in the 2007 Distinguished International Scientist Awards to our team our efficient collaboration will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of MA abuse on the developing brain which will help develop more efficacious prevention and treatment strategies for the fastest growing street drug in the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This longitudinal follow-up neuroimaging study for adolescent methamphetamine (MA) dependent subjects will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of MA abuse on the developing brain in adolescence. In particular we wish to evaluate whether MA use during adolescence is associated with long-term adverse effects on frontal lobe structure and function. This knowledge will help develop more efficacious prevention and treatment strategies for the fastest growing street drug in the United States.      ","284575",

Electrophysiological (EP) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmias are among the most prolonged and detailed due to the difficulties in the guidance of catheter based diagnostic and therapeutic devices within the cardiovascular system. Although fluoroscopy is still the gold standard imaging tool it is well recognized that with longer and more challenging procedures new and more effective real time spatial mapping tools are vitally needed to improve clinical outcomes and to reduce the fluoroscopic radiation doses to which patients are currently exposed. Also a recent review of ablation methods in Circulation stated that ""Radiofrequency is the dominant energy source used but remains inadequate to ensure lesion continuity and permanence without an unacceptable increase in procedural time and complications. New effective and safe alternative energy sources are needed to achieve the ultimate goal of a single widely applicable curative procedure for all forms of AF (atrial fibrillation)."" Our project is targeted at this major cardiovascular problem in our aging population concordant with the mission of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Our Partnership of clinicians electrophysiologists and engineers from academic institutions and companies is proposing to develop new highly miniaturized and unique intracardiac imaging devices on steerable electrophysiology catheters which can provide 2D and 3D ultrasound imaging to fully integrate imaging lesion characterization and therapy within the same catheter devices.  We also propose: to expand the capabilities for ablation with these devices from RF energy to newer methods including High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and laser ablation both of which can create more focused and discrete continuous lesions. We will also develop and provide on-line capabilities to allow rapid evaluation of the results and effectiveness of EP ablation procedures. These include methods such as thermal strain imaging to assess tissue heating and laser acoustic tissue characterization and ultrasound methods for defining altered mechanical properties of ablated tissue displayed on 3D fusion displays of electroanatomical mapping of the chambers of the heart and the propagation of normal and abnormal conduction of cardiac rhythms. Our proposed project builds on our first 5 years of funding combining the newest most advanced and miniaturized ultrasound transducer technologies and cabling and connection methods with the ability to integrate imaging and assessment with direct energy delivery for ablation within the same EP catheter-based ablation devices. It is our expectation that the results of our work can improve the efficacy and availability of these complex treatment strategies while reducing procedure duration radiation exposure and cost.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Serious abnormalities of cardiac rhythms such as the rapid and irregular rhythms referred to as atrial fibrillation often require treatment by trans-catheter ablation procedures. These long and complicated procedures have variable success rates and the abnormal rhythm episodes often recur. Our Partnership of clinicians and engineers is planning to develop new catheter-based methods for performing ablation with integration of energy delivery and ultrasound imaging from inside the heart chambers with the goal of reducing the duration of these procedures minimizing radiation exposure to the patient and the physician and improving the results of ablation.      ","1651951",

Despite National guidelines that recommend collaboration with the parent for effective asthma care most primary care providers (PCPs) do not provide on- going self-management education or support and effective interventions to improve maintenance care are difficult to disseminate into office practice. Our prior NHLBI-funded work focused on reducing asthma-related morbidity and healthcare use in children from low-income urban neighborhoods. We have demonstrated that a lay asthma coach can improve self-management behaviors and reduce asthma hospitalizations and can improve rates of follow-up with a PCP after an emergency department visit. In this competitive renewal application we will extend our successful theory-based coaching model into the general asthma population and integrate coaching into office-based care with the Telephone Asthma Coaching program (TAC). We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the TAC program. The coaching intervention will occur at the level of the parent but to minimize contamination randomization will occur at the level of the physician. Using a stratified cluster design we will randomize 24 community pediatricians to the intervention or usual care control group. All participating physicians (intervention and control groups) will receive a summary of the most recent NAEPP guidelines patient education materials and a registry of their asthma patients. Physicians in the intervention group will participate in two brief meetings to introduce coaching and to tailor implementation of the intervention to their practice. Parents of asthmatic children they care for will be invited to participate in the TAC program and work with an off site asthma coach to facilitate effective self-management and a collaborative partnership with the PCP. We will evaluate this pragmatic intervention in the community and develop educational materials for PCPs coaches and parents to facilitate widespread program dissemination. Our hypothesis is that the intervention will reduce asthma morbidity among children by improving maintenance care provided by the parent and the PCP and these changes will be maintained. The target population is asthmatic children who are 5 to 12 years old and had >1 urgent care episode in the prior 12 months. All outcomes will be measured by parent interviews and chart audits at 12 and 24 months. The measurement cohort will average 40 patients/PCP (total 1000 patients). We will determine if the intervention: reduces asthma impairment measured as improved asthma control and asthma-related quality of life; reduces asthma risk measured by urgent care episodes among the target population in 12-months; and improves adherence to National guidelines for asthma care by the PCP. We will assess cost effectiveness from the perspective of the payor and society. Collaboration between key players in community-based asthma care resulted in development of the TAC program and affords an opportunity to evaluate this model to translate research into office-based practice.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing asthma morbidity is a public health priority. This project will evaluate if a telephone asthma coaching program that is integrated into office practice will reduce asthma morbidity among children by improving maintenance care provided by the parent and the PCP and if the program is cost-effective.      ","636754",

A central issue in achieving this goal is to understand how the stromal microenvironment regulates the invasive behavior of normal epithelia during pubertal development and how mammary luminal and myoepithelial cells interact to form a stable ductal tree. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are expressed in the stroma. They play a role in normal tissue remodeling during development and also contribute to the pathogenesis of tumor progression. The present proposal addresses the mechanisms by which these stromal MMPs orchestrate the cross talk between mesenchymal and epithelial compartments. The goal for this proposal is to dissect in molecular and cell biological detail how MMPs affect branching morphogenesis through their ability to orchestrate the stromal microenvironment of the breast. The project will use a toolbox of genetically modified mice and mammary cells organotypic cell culture models and in vivo transplantation systems to interrogate these models and determine the critical substrates of MMPs what signaling pathways are regulated by MMPs and how intercellular communication is affected by MMPs. The organotypic cultures will be analyzed for growth morphogenesis differentiation and invasive behavior using a combination of live cell imaging biochemistry and cell biology. In vivo analysis will utilize genetically modified mammary glands and orthotopic transplants of mammary epithelial cells transduced with wild type and mutated MMPs their inhibitors and substrates. The role of MMPs in fine-tuning intercellular communication during branching morphogenesis will be studied with emphasize on myoepithelial cells. The study will focus on candidate substrates in the Wnt pathway for MMP3/stromelysin and how their cleavage by MMPs affects signaling in the mammary epithelium. By dissecting how these signaling pathways operate in balancing stem cell activation proliferation and differentiation and the mechanical environment in the pubertal mammary gland the applications to breast cancer should continue to unfold. These experiments will give insights into how misregulation of MMPs directly leads to the development of breast cancer. An understanding of how MMPs function in the normal tissue and how disruption of their function promotes neoplasia is necessary to achieve the long-term goal of finding cures for breast cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women and is the most common cancer among women. This study addresses an important aspect of women's health of how matrix metalloproteinases regulate normal and neoplastic mammary gland function. The approaches used in this project will elucidate how MMPs alter the structural microenvironment and how this influences the critical responses of growth and invasion in normal and abnormal mammary gland epithelium and stroma. These studies may form the basis of intervention and therapy in breast cancer potentially in the premalignant lesions.        ","560252",

Both spontaneous abortion and preeclampsia which is associated with abnormal placentation occur at increased frequency in human and bovine pregnancies established by assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our long-term goals are to understand the immunological basis of immune-mediated abortion and placental insufficiency and to develop and test strategies to down-regulate the immune response to the conceptus. A unique bovine model of immune- mediated abortion and placental insufficiency based on the routine occurrence of inadequate placental development and fetal loss in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) pregnancies will be used. Several observations support the validity of this model: (1) placental trophoblast cells of SCNT fetuses in contrast to control fetuses express classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) antigens early in pregnancy (2) T lymphocytes accumulate in the uterine stroma of SCNT recipients and (3) MHC homozygous SCNT fetuses fare better than MHC heterozygous fetuses. These findings suggest that much of the fetal loss in SCNT pregnancies is due to immune-mediated abortion. This project is based on the general hypothesis that inappropriate trophoblast MHC-I expression early in pregnancy will induce immune-mediated abortion or placental insufficiency. Inappropriate expression of MHC-I proteins may consist of increased expression of classical MHC-I proteins decreased expression of non-classical MHC-I proteins or a combination of the two. The proposal's specific aims are: (1) produce 8-10 MHC-I compatible SCNT 8-10 MHC-I incompatible SCNT and 8-10 control pregnancies for collection of uterine and placental tissues on days 32 to 34 of pregnancy and compare trophoblast MHC-I expression uterine leukocyte populations and uterine and placental gene expression in the three types of pregnancies; and (2) compare embryonic mortality rates of SCNT embryos transferred into MHC-I compatible and incompatible recipient cows to determine if immune-mediated abortion can be avoided by eliminating the antigenic MHC-I trigger. This project will elucidate the functional genomics of the cross-talk between the placenta and uterine immune system in normal and abnormal pregnancies. Functional genomics and morphological data will be integrated to create a complete picture of the cellular and molecular events involved in an important clinical problem: immune-mediated abortion. The project will also directly test the hypothesis that abnormal MHC-I expression early in pregnancy triggers immune-mediated abortion a long-standing hypothesis that has never been adequately tested because of lack of a suitable animal model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A mammalian conceptus must convince its mother's immune system to accept it. When the fetus fails to induce maternal tolerance the outcome is either immune-mediated abortion or the development of abnormal placentation that can result in problems later in pregnancy. The incidence of immune-mediated abortion and placental insufficiency in both humans and cattle are greatly increased with the use of assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization. In this study bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer pregnancies which normally have a high rate of first trimester spontaneous abortions will be used to study how communications between the conceptus and maternal immune system break down when embryos are manipulated in vitro.      ","298138",

The initial funding cycle facilitated a productive collaboration and these efforts have revealed promising new directions for research to more fully encompass the multiple challenges posed by exposure and reproductive health data collected under motivating studies such as the Michigan PBB Studies (MIPBB) and the Mount Sinai Study of Women Office Workers (MSSWOW). As in many longitudinal studies exposure assays utilized in the MIPBB underwent an evolution over time so that data obtained via the original and more recent assays are recorded at different levels of resolution. In particular data obtained earlier in the study were primarily ""heaped"" due to assay limitations that effectively led values to be rounded to the nearest integer. Proper analysis of the longitudinal data should attribute the correct level of resolution to each data point based on the assay used to record it. In epidemiologic studies it is also common to observe highly skewed exposure data. The simultaneous features of heavy skewness detection limit issues changing assay resolution over time and heaping due to rounding require flexible and innovative modeling with the ultimate aim of improved prediction and valid determination of associations between exposure and reproductive health outcomes (Aim 1). Our research to date motivated by the MSSWOW study has identified new avenues of research into the modeling of time-to-pregnancy and menstrual cycle length data. In such studies time-to-pregnancy is typically recorded in terms of a number of cycles as opposed to being measured in days or weeks so that methods for discrete data survival analysis are required. Modeling innovations are needed in order to relate environmental exposures and other covariates to fertility in such contexts (Aim 2). Repeated menstrual cycle length data tend to be characterized by heterogeneity not only in average length but in the level of variability as well. This motivates a need for flexible modeling and improved methods for classifying women into menstrual cycle length and variability subgroups and brings attention to potential misclassification error (Aim3). This renewal application continues to seek improved analytic methods for epidemiologic research by means of an effective balance between statistical theory and application in the environmental and reproductive health areas. We consider both parametric and semi-parametric approaches noting that both have their advantages in this context and that each approach has the potential to inform and augment the other. While intended to be of direct benefit to the motivating studies the methods to be developed address issues that are common and fundamental enough to make them of broader interest in statistical and epidemiologic practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Environmental exposures can have a major impact on various aspects of public health     including women's reproductive health. This application aims to address multiple unique challenges in the analysis of exposure and reproductive health outcome data stemming from two landmark motivating studies. The statistical methods to be developed will also have broader implications toward public health studies that collect exposure and outcome data over time.        ","279000",

As cell migration is the central part of metastasis we are developing quantitative experimental and computational methods to study migration in three dimensional matrices. Our preliminary studies have indicated that cancer cell migration in two and three dimensional matrices is significantly different. The effects of matrix structure and mechanics as well as extracellular degradation by proteolytic enzymes can not be studied in existing two dimensional assays. This lack of information about key processes and variables leads to incomplete and inaccurate understanding. Our goal is to rectify these problems by quantifying tumor cell migration in native like three dimensional environments. In the proposed studies we will develop a system level understanding of tumor cell migration. The individual and collective roles of cell adhesion matrix composition matrix structure and proteolysis will be studied in well established prostate cancer cell lines. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) Quantify the systematic interactions of integrins and extracellular matrix in regulating three -dimensional tumor cell motility 2) Quantify the effects of extracellular matrix structure on protease activity in tumor cells and 3) Develop multi-scale computational models to predict and quantify cell adhesion and migration in three dimensional matrices. Our ability to combat and cure cancer rests on our understanding of the processes regulating metastasis.

By combining experiments and simulations carried out in controlled environments that mimic in vivo settings we will be able to quantify the individual and collective roles of matrix and cells in tumor cell migration.

The genome of this soil bacterium contains 18 cytochrome P450s (CYP) genes 6 ferredoxin genes and 4 ferredoxin reductase genes. This complex of monooxygenase systems plays important roles in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites organic molecules which serve several different roles in S. coelicolor particularly protection against toxic organisms and compounds in the environment. Many of these compounds are known to have biomedical activity and are used in treatment of human disease. The P450s are not essential for primary metabolism in this and other streptomycetes but oxidatively tailor secondary metabolites influencing both potency and specificity. Engineering of these P450s can lead to novel compounds having new biomedical capacity and the goal of this project is to develop a biochemical paradigm for generating new metabolites. During the current granting period we have developed the necessary technology and obtained preliminary data which will permit us to move aggressively forward in addressing this goal. This project involves two laboratories at Vanderbilt (Waterman and Guengerich) and two at the University of Wales now Swansea University (Kelly and Lamb) and three Specific Aims. (1) Determination of Function of Streptomyces P450s - will be carried out using prediction of substrate based on location of CYP genes in operons having known activity in cells or based on similarity of primary sequence with P450s of known function and use of knockout strains for analysis of differences in metabolite profiles compared to the wild type strain. These differences are measured using sophisticated GC-MS and LC-MS technologies. (2) Structure Determination of Streptomyces P450s and Biophysical Investigation of Novel P450 Properties -we will focus our effort of CYP X-ray structure determination primarily on P450s having known functions to characterize how substrates bind in the active sites. (3) Generation of Novel Secondary Metabolites in S. coelicolor - putting together our understanding of CYP function with that of CYP structure we will generate novel secondary metabolites relying on site directed mutagenesis product analysis expression of mutant enzymes in S. coelicolor and additional structure determination (if necessary). During the 40 months of the current funding period we have been surprised to find several novel features of these P450s (described within) which expand our understanding of the diversity of this superfamily of monooxygenases. As part of Aim 2 we will further investigate these properties. The significance of these three Specific Aims is that they will develop a paradigm for engineering novel streptomyces secondary metabolites with the potential of important new biomedical relevance and will provide new insights into cytochrome P450 structure/function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This competing renewal of ""S. coelicolor P450s: Structure/Function/Engineering"" will continue ongoing studies of P450s in a well characterized soil bacterium with the long term goal to develop a paradigm for using modification of these monooxygenases to generate novel biomedically relevant secondary metabolites. Actinomycetes (including S. coelicolor) produce a large number of different secondary metabolites many of which have biomedical relevance. In many cases P450s oxidatively tailor these molecules near the end of their biosynthetic pathways and modification of P450s can lead to new compounds having novel potency and specificity.      ","438386",

We are approaching this issue as a Multi-PI team using the model genetic system Drosophila. The CG4395 gene encodes a Class B peptide G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) highly related to mammalian receptors for Calcitonin and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide. CG4395 specific antibodies and CG4395-promoter constructs reveal that CG4395 is prominently expressed in olfactory receptor neurons that respond to pheromone as well as in higher regions of the brain that have been implicated in courtship behavior and plasticity. Significantly mutant male flies that lack CG4395 gene expression exhibit aberrant courtship behavior. Furthermore this behavioral defect can be restored to mutant animals by expressing a CG4395 transgene in olfactory sensory neurons. These findings lead us to hypothesize that peptide neuromodulation via CG4395 regulates courtship-relevant pheromone processing. The CG4395 GPCR is an orphan but it responds potently to a peptide factor in Drosophila head extracts which we have greatly enriched by three HPLC steps and now propose to purify to homogeneity. We also propose to use the power afforded by Drosophila genetics to study the CG4395 receptor and peptide ligand separately and together in vivo to learn where and when receptor signaling occurs. We will combine a battery of molecular genetic tools with detailed behavioral analyses to understand the roles of the receptor and ligand in courtship. In addition we will employ a novel genetically-encoded real-time reporter of cAMP levels that uses in vivo FRET measurement regulated by CG4395 as revealed by a novel genetic reporter. To achieve these goals demands skills greater than can be assembled in any current Drosophila laboratory. Therefore this research program represents the collaborative efforts of three independent groups each of which contributes specific expertise and technical experience. Neuromodulatory transmitter systems regulate numerous higher brain functions including attention memory mood appetite social behavior and aggression. When transmitter systems go awry clinical problems often arise. Identifying modulatory peptides and cognate receptors is therefore a key endeavor in studying the mechanisms underlying behavior. GPCRs and their signaling pathways are highly conserved in evolution thus the molecular mechanisms of neuromodulation we aim to describe will offer potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Neuromodulation is fundamentally important for higher brain functions and regulates diverse brain-based phenomena including attention memory mood appetite and aggressive behaviors. The normal actions of monoamine and peptide transmitters systems are keys to such modulation and when these transmitter systems go awry these processes are compromised and clinical problems arise. This research program uses biochemical and genetic approaches to explore fundamental mechanisms underlying modulation of the neural circuits that regulate reproductive behaviors (courtship) in the model system Drosophila.          ","433580",

This includes the diffusion of small molecules and the selective active transport of large proteins and RNA. Proper NPC biogenesis is critical for cell division differentiation and responses to changes in metabolic activities. Understanding NPC assembly at the molecular level will be key for designing strategies to inhibit cell growth and gene expression for example in oncogenesis. However the molecular pathway for de novo insertion of NPCs into the intact nuclear envelope (NE) is largely undefined. The most outstanding question in the field involves delineating how nuclear pore formation is executed and regulated. The pathway for coordinating interactions between at least 30 different NPC proteins (Nups) and multiple pore membrane proteins (Poms) is unknown. This project aims to reveal the molecular biogenesis mechanism for the NPC transport apparatus. Our specific aims will each utilize aggressive yeast S. cerevisiae genetics/biochemistry/cell biology-based approaches directly coupled with state-of-the-art microscopy and biochemistry in metazoan cells and the Xenopus egg extract in vitro assembly system. This innovative merger of strengths in multiple model systems is only possible through the full-fledged collaborative efforts of the two PIs. We speculate that de novo assembly is a step-wise process. Our first specific aim will address early assembly events at the NE and chromatin. Using a novel set of yeast NPC assembly mutants and in vitro Xenopus assays we will identify the essential Nups and assembly factors that are targeted to chromatin outer and/or inner nuclear membranes. The targeting mechanism and role in assembly will be directly tested. The second aim will focus on the mechanism for fusion of the outer and inner nuclear membranes i.e. formation of a pore across the NE and builds on our recent discovery of ER/NE proteins required for NPC assembly and our novel pore fusion assay in Xenopus extracts. We hypothesize that the highly curved pore membranes are formed by the action of Poms stabilized by transient association of the reticulons and maintained by the recruitment of a membrane coat formed by the Nup107-160/Nup84 complex. In the third aim we will analyze the coordination between sequential steps in the biogenesis process. Assembly intermediates will be examined by scanning electron microscopy and purified from yeast mutant cells arrested at distinct steps. We will also pinpoint the order of metazoan Nup recruitment after membrane hole formation by fluorescence imaging of NPC assembly with single pore resolution in real time. Together these studies will define the membrane fusion machinery and the sequence of self-assembly steps for NPC biogenesis in intact NEs.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transport of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm is essential for all aspects of normal cell function and requires large protein machines (nuclear pore complexes) to allow cargo movement. Trafficking is perturbed in some disease states such as cancer and viral infections and there are also genetically heritable diseases that are linked to changes in the genes encoding transport factors and nuclear pore complexes. Knowledge of how nuclear pore complexes are assembled and function will be important for finding therapeutic strategies to regulate nuclear transport in disease states and moderate viral proliferation/pathogenesis.      ","459909",

Somatically amplification of genomic DNA is a common mechanism exploited by a tumor to gain a competitive growth advantage. Regions of amplification tend to span considerable distances and encompass many genes. Identification of the target loci within the amplicon will enable a refined understanding of the genetic pathways driving tumor progression. The number of target genes that have been revealed relative to the number of recurrent amplifications however is low. The hypothesis is that particular germline alleles within an amplicon are positively selected for during tumor evolution and therefore achieve a higher allele frequency among amplified (versus non-amplified) chromosomes. Aim 1 adapts principles from the fields of population and statistical genetics to develop the methodological tools to test the hypothesis. Aim 2 applies these tools in a systematic fashion across 1900 tumor genomes that have been extensively characterized for amplifications. Lastly in Aim 3 promising candidate regions will be subjected to fine mapping and validation to isolate the actual allele under selection. The heart of the dataset for this study contains over 2000 tumors and cancer cell lines encompassing multiple tissue types. DNA from each sample has already been profiled on Affymetrix chips for over 230000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. This platform allows for integration of information across the germline (alleles) and tumor (amplifications) genomes. The novel application of statistical and population genetic techniques to this large and high-resolution dataset will facilitate the discovery of specific regions within an amplicon under positive selection. Pinpointing candidate regions suggests downstream functional assays which can be immediately pursued. Relevance of research to public health: The identification of the specific targets of tumor amplification has already had a profound effect on the prognostic (MYCN in neuroblastoma) and therapeutic (ERBB2 in breast cancer) realms of clinical oncology. The proposed research aims to perform a genome wide survey to systematically delineate the target genes in regions of copy number gain in multiple tumor types. Discovery of the genes and pathways contributing to tumor survival and progression will allow for more refined clinical decision-making.        ","321867",

In contrast in normal aging the cause of the relatively mild cognitive impairments that develops remains unclear as cortical neurons are not lost. However cortical neurons have been shown to become dysfunctional in a number of ways ranging from deterioration of myelinated axons that interconnect cortical areas to changes in action potential generation at the soma. A critical functional component of cortical information processing is the microcolumn a vertical array of neurons that are tightly interconnected and that work together to process fundamental information. The classic example is the orientation column of the visual cortex. Accumulating evidence suggests that age-related changes in microcolumnar organization may be an important marker of age-related cortical dysfunction. Age-related alterations in microcolumns will be addressed using archival brain material available from a study of rhesus monkeys in which all animals are behaviorally tested to characterize cognitive status and the brains are harvested for neurobiological study. The first aim is to acquire whole brain photomontages to quantitatively assess microcolumnar structure throughout the entire cerebral cortex of both male and female rhesus monkeys that cover the entire adult life span. This will identify regions where the greatest age-related disruptions in microcolumns occur and where those changes are most strongly related to cognitive impairments. This will test the hypothesis that regional alterations in microcolumnar structure and associated cortical dysfunction account for age-related cognitive impairments. Based on the identification of most affected cortical areas Aim 2 will utilize immunohistochemical methods to label intracellular cytoskeletal elements of dendrites of cortical neurons. These will be analyzed to test the hypothesis that alterations in dendritic structure are associated with the disruption of microcolumnar architecture. Similarly Aim 3 will utilize NeuN immunohistochemistry to uniquely separate neurons from glia allowing for separate analysis of glia changes. This aim will test the hypothesis that disruptions in glial distribution are associated with age-related disruption of microcolumns. For both dendrites and glia cross correlation methods will be used to quantify the relationship to microcolumn changes and for all three aims multivariate methods will assess the relationship with cognitive impairments. These data will generate testable mechanistic hypotheses regarding the causes of microcolumnar dysfunction and will provide insight into the basis of age-related cortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Future directions for this study will include analysis of the small but functionally significant population of GABAergic neurons and the distribution of intercellular adhesion molecules that bind the cortex together. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In normal aging cognitive dysfunction occurs without the loss of cortical neurons yet evidence indicates disruption of the architecture of vertical arrays of cortical neurons that are organized as microcolumns. These microcolumns are a fundamental computational unit of the cerebral cortex and their age-related degradation correlates with age-related cognitive impairment. These will be studied using advanced quantitative methods and compared with changes in dendritic structure and glia cells to determine the processes underlying age-related cognitive impairments.      ","525897",

In our approach fluorescent groups are introduced in the ribosome that by FRET interaction with fluorescently-labeled tRNAs allow initial aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A-site tRNA translocation to the P-site and release of discharged tRNA from the E-site to be monitored on single ribosomes in real time. This approach will provide a detailed continuous kinetic profile of mRNA translation during continuous elongation providing unique insights into the regulation of translation rates in protein synthesis that are important for cell function. We will determine kinetic profiles for expression of i) short model mRNAs containing known pausing elements regulating translation; ii) complete mRNAs coding for full proteins; and iii) designed mutations of such mRNAs that permit rigorous evaluation of the effects of pausing elements singly or in groups in the context of full protein synthesis. Such determinations will allow new understanding of the roles such pauses play in biologically important processes and providing suggestions for optimizing cell-free protein synthesis systems. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine translation profiles for model mRNAs. We will determine translation kinetic profiles for model mRNAs incorporating known pausing elements (rare codons downstream mRNA 2o structure upstream nascent peptides) either one at a time or in tandem. The information obtained will quantify effects of such elements on translation and elucidate the mechanism of the intrinsic ribosomal helicase. 2. Determine translation rates for full-length mRNAs. We will determine translation kinetic profiles for full length mRNAs and specifically designed mutants of such mRNAs in order to determine how surrounding context influences the effect of a given pausing element or group of pausing elements on translation rate beginning with the mRNAs coding for E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CATIII). 3. Optimize the reagents employed in the TIRFM-FRET approach. The principal improvements over currently available reagents will be directed toward i. reducing background from fluorescently-labeled tRNA by derivatizing EF-Tu with a fluorescence quencher; ii. synthesizing a larger variety of fluorescent tRNAs; and iii. labeling ribosomes with quantum dots for increased stability toward photobleaching. 4. Optimize the apparatus and methods needed for the TIRFM-FRET approach. Several improvements to the apparatus software and procedures will be accomplished to enable collection of long kinetic sequences from the onset of elongation with high fidelity and minimum perturbation by photobleaching. The image processing software used to quantify single molecule FRET pairs and their efficiencies will be improved optimized and statistically validated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Three major consequences will flow from our work. First we will be able to examine the effects of known translational pausing elements in the context of complete protein chain expression and to determine if new elements and synergistic effects can be identified. Second we will be able to systematically explore the role translational pausing plays in the integration of protein synthesis and cellular function focusing on such issues as the tradeoff between speed and accuracy in translation at functionally crucial residues and the possible coupling of translational pausing and co-translational protein folding. Third we will be able to provide important information with respect to optimizing cell-free protein translation systems.      ","298607",

We propose to investigate the hypothesis that maternal exposure during pregnancy to ambient air pollution (CO NO2 O3 PM2.5 PM10 SO2) and traffic (a significant local source of air pollution) is associated with increased risk for low birth weight (<2500 gm) preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation) and small for gestational age birth (< 10th percentile weight for gestational age). Several studies have examined the relationships between these adverse birth outcomes and maternal exposure to ambient air pollution but results have been inconclusive. A major impediment to this research has been the large sample size needed to investigate these relationships as well as the level of personal information needed to address potential confounders and accurately estimate exposure throughout pregnancy. This study will utilize two related datasets for the same geographic area and time period: (1) an existing cohort of women (N=10524) followed prospectively throughout pregnancy by the Yale Center for Perinatal Pediatric and Environmental Epidemiology; and (2) birth certificate data (480000 singleton live births in CT and MA 2000 to 2006). The cohort data provides well characterized variables to control for all major confounders and information about each of the mothers' residences throughout pregnancy to accurately assess exposure. The birth certificate data provides the statistical power to investigate severe less frequent outcomes (very low birth weight <1500 gm very preterm delivery <32 weeks) and to examine the effects of air pollution and traffic among African American women already at risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight. A comparison study will also be conducted to determine the reliability of birth certificate data for use in air pollution research. Since all exposure assessments have some limitations we propose four methods to measure exposure to air pollutants: central site monitors; a GIS/traffic model; land use regression to measure NO2 exposure; and satellite imagery to measure PM2.5 exposure. The proposed study will have the power to estimate odds ratios of 1.15 and 1.25 in the birth certificate and cohort data respectively. If an association is confirmed reductions in specific types of air pollution may result in a reduction in adverse birth outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Preterm delivery and low birth weight are major causes of infant death and disability in the United States. This study will investigate whether a mother's exposure during pregnancy to air pollution and traffic (a significant local source of air pollution) is associated with increased risk for these adverse birth outcomes. If confirmed reductions in specific types of air pollution may reduce these major infant health problems.          ","593654",

One such intersection the interconversion of a-ketoglutarate and glutamate is particularly important and interesting because it represents the point of coupling between central carbon metabolism and central nitrogen metabolism. Synthesis of the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid branch of the Krebs cycle (citrate synthase aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase) that produce a-ketoglutarate and the enzymes of nitrogen assimilation (glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase) are encoded by genes that are subject to multiple forms of regulation. This project seeks to understand in detail the molecular mechanisms that regulate these genes in Bacillus subtilis a well studied model Gram-positive bacterium and Listeria monocytogenes a model intracellular pathogen whose metabolic regulation is relatively unexplored. The proposal focuses on three transcriptional regulators (CcpC GltC and GlnR) and two enzymes (glutamate dehydrogenase and aconitase) that have post-transcriptional regulatory functions. The aims of this proposal are: (a) to determine the molecular mechanisms that control the synthesis and activity of the tricarboxylic acid branch enzymes; (b) to reveal the molecular mechanisms that control the synthesis of glutamate and glutamine; and (c) to determine the role of aconitase as a post-transcriptional regulator of sporulation in B. subtilis and of iron metabolism and virulence genes in L. monocytogenes. These issues will be addressed using a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques. The phenotypes of mutants defective in each of the regulatory factors will be determined and the proteins will be purified and tested using in vitro transcription and DNA and RNA binding experiments. Since L. monocytogenes mutants that lack two repressors of the Krebs cycle genes have a significant defect in virulence in a mouse model the molecular basis for this defect will be explored. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Maintaining the proper balance in intracellular metabolism is a critical factor in bacterial growth survival and pathogenesis. This proposal aims to unravel the intricate mechanisms by which two related bacterial species Bacillus subtilis (a non-pathogen) and Listeria monocytogenes (the causative agent of listeriosis) control the flow of metabolites between central carbon and central nitrogen pathways. The knowledge gained will provide a deeper understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and may aid in designing novel inhibitors of bacterial growth and pathogenesis.      ","287948",

This is a competitive renewal application to continue our studies of the secreted protein lubricin (encoded by the gene PRG4) which is expressed by superficial zone chondrocytes and type B synoviocytes. We and other investigators have shown that lubricin is critically important in the protection and maintenance of articulating joints. We have demonstrated that lubricin prevents mechanical wear of articular cartilage. Humans and mice that genetically lack lubricin develop precocious cartilage failure and synovial hyperplasia. We have observed acquired alterations of lubricin in patients with common joint diseases including osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic joint injury. These acquired alterations of lubricin can include changes in protein abundance the expression of different protein splice-forms and specific post-translational processing events such as glycosylation and protein cleavage which appear to be important to the protein's biological and mechanical activities. We have three overall research goals. First we want to understand precisely how the different lubricin splice-forms and post-translational modifications contribute to the protein's diverse cell biologic structural and biophysical properties. We will accomplish this by studying protein and tissue recovered from wild-type animals lubricin-mutant animals and transgenic mice that express specific lubricin splice-forms or lubricin proteins that have been mutated to prevent normal post-translational processing. In aim two we will develop a reliable and reproducible methodology for inducing and measuring wear in whole joints. This will enable us to understand how lubricin prevents wear in vivo. It is important to appreciate that not all good lubricants prevent wear. Therefore we want to precisely define how lubricin prevents wear and which of its post-translational modifications are important to this activity. Third we want to correlate acquired alterations of lubricin with common diseases of joints and determine whether these lubricin alterations are causes or consequences. We will do this by analyzing synovial fluid and serum from cohorts of patients affected by common joint diseases and from animal models of acquired joint disease such as traumatic joint injury and inflammatory arthritis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. This research aims to understand how the secreted protein lubricin protects mammalian joints. Genetic absence of lubricin cause precocious joint failure. Our preliminary data suggest that acquired alterations of lubricin contribute to the progression of joint disease in patients with more common diseases affecting joints such as osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic joint injury. We will study mice that express different forms of lubricin and also study biologic samples from patients with normal and damaged joints to begin correlating lubricin variation with human joint health.      ","524814",

The enzymes employ a conserved free-radical mechanism. Class I RNRs including the human and Herpes Simplex Virus I enzymes use a stable tyrosyl radical to initiate this mechanism and are validated drug targets. Several of the drugs function (at least in part) by reducing the tyrosyl radical. The tyrosyl radical is introduced into the enzyme by reaction of a di-iron(II) center with O2. Class I RNRs found in important human pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis lack the tyrosyl radical. The C. trachomatis RNR is nevertheless active. We recently showed that the C. trachomatis RNR uses a stable Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cofactor in place of the tyrosyl radical to initiates its reaction. The cofactor undergoes reduction to the Mn(III)/Fe(III) form to generate a protein radical that abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The Ct RNR is the first example of a manganese-dependent RNR and its cofactor is the first example of a Mn/Fe redox center in biology. The cofactor is introduced analogously to the tyrosyl radical in the conventional class I RNRs by reaction of the reduced [Mn(II)/Fe(II)] metal center with O2. In this reaction a Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) accumulates to a high level. In this project we will elucidate the mechanisms of the formation and catalytic function of this novel cofactor. We will define the structures of its Mn(II)/Fe(II) Mn(IIII)/Fe(III) Mn(IV)/Fe(III) and Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) states by spectroscopic and computational methods and x-ray crystallography. We will understand how the protein protects the oxidized cofactor from adventitious reduction but then allows it to be reduced at the appropriate time to form the hydrogen-abstracting protein radical. We will study its chemical reactivity to uncover unique vulnerabilities that might be exploited in design of new drugs against the pathogens that use this type of RNR. Finally we will compare the structures of closely related pairs of RNRs of which one uses the standard tyrosyl radical and the other the novel Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cofactor for clues to the design of both systems and the evolution of one from another. We will then attempt to use these clues to rationally convert one type of RNR into the other by changing crucial amino acids. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the key step in DNA biosynthesis of all organisms and is a validated target for treatment of cancer and viral diseases. We recently reported that the class Ic RNR from the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis uses a novel redox cofactor (a heterobinuclear Mn/Fe cluster) to initiate catalysis. The structure and mechanism of this novel RNR will be elucidated to facilitate the rational development of class Ic RNR inhibitors that could be used to treat diseases caused by C. trachomatis and several other human pathogens (e.g. Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis).      ","464025",

Image contrast for this MR method is based on microscopic incoherent water displacements. Within minutes of brain injury water displacements (measured as the ""apparent diffusion coefficient"" or ADC) are reduced. Remarkably the underlying biophysical basis for this decrease in ADC is not yet understood though it appears related primarily to a reduction of the displacements of water in the intracellular space. We propose to better characterize the cellular-level changes in water displacement that accompany injury and allow detection of injury by diffusion-based MR imaging. A clearer understanding of the basis for diffusion contrast associated with cell injury will lead to more effective use of this MR method in the clinic and as a research tool. These studies will also provide values for intracellular water exchange lifetimes and cell membrane permeabilities for various cell types. This information will be useful for MR experiments in which tissue modeling of tissue water compartmentation is necessary. Our approach involves two model systems   tissue culture and intact rat brain. With regards to tissue culture there is indirect evidence that the response of glial cells to injury differs from that of neurons with glial cells showing a larger change in intracellular water ADC. If this is the case then diffusion imaging may be relatively insensitive to injury to neurons per se. We will test this hypothesis by measuring the response of intracellular water ADC to injury for neurons glia and skeletal muscle cells in culture. We will also use the data obtained from these cells in association with their geometry as measured through microscopy to develop models of the behavior of intracellular water. Studies of intact brain will involve diffusion measurements of reporter molecules confined to the intracellular space. These molecules will be cesium (a potassium analog which will be present in all cells) and N- acetylaspartate (NAA present only in neurons). Since these molecules are present in the aqueous phase of cytoplasm changes in their ADC values reflect changes in that of the intracellular water in which they are hydrated. Data from cesium and NAA before and after global ischemia will be evaluated in terms of the information obtained from tissue culture systems including models specific for the geometries of neurons and glia. Finally studies of intact rat brain will include measurement of intracellular water diffusion characteristics. This will be done by separating signal from intra- and extracellular water on the basis of differences in T1 relaxation following intracerebroventricular infusion of a relaxation agent. The models developed in the studies above will be applied to these data to determine the changes in intracellular viscosity associated with brain injury.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to improve our understanding of how diffusion MR images detect brain injury. This is important because diffusion imaging will likely be used in the near future to identify people who would benefit from treatments to reduce brain injury after events such as a stroke. A better understanding of how this imaging works would enable us to use it more rationally and effectively.      ","475470",

Genetic instability is one characteristic of cancer cells and explains how they accumulate multiple genetic alterations that promote tumorigenic growth. Cells with defective DNA damage and replication stress response capabilities exhibit high rates of genomic instability. Therefore we aim to define the components of DNA damage/replication stress response pathways and determine how they work cooperatively to prevent cancer by regulating the cell cycle promoting DNA repair or initiating apoptosis. The ATR (ATM and rad3-related) kinase functions at the apex of a DNA damage and replication stress response pathway. In the previous funding period we defined several mechanisms by which the ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) promotes ATR specific responses to genotoxic stress. Our results as well as those of other researchers suggest a multi-step model for ATR signaling regulation but many questions remain unanswered. We hypothesize that ATR-ATRIP activation in response to genotoxic stress is regulated through multiple mechanisms including RPA-dependent localization TopBP1 binding and phosphorylation. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches. Components of the ATR signaling pathway are frequently mutated in several human diseases; ATR activation is a major cellular response to most commonly used cancer therapies; and the ATR pathway is expected to be a useful drug target. Therefore these mechanistic studies focus on highly significant biological questions.      ","266843",

The condition is associated with an adverse prognosis and healthcare costs similar to obstructive CAD there are an estimated 2-3 million women with existent disease and a projected 100000 new cases annually. This places the prevalence morbidity and costs of coronary vascular dysfunction higher than all female reproductive cancers combined. Prospective testing of a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and prognosis is needed as critical next steps toward translation of our findings into clinical care. Using a prospective cohort design with follow-up we aim to investigate: 1) Abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) predicts abnormalities in coronary reactivity testing (CRT); 2) Persistent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) abnormalities at 1-year follow-up predict persistent symptoms of ischemia; 3) CMRI predicts adverse outcomes and thus can be used as an outcome in future therapeutic trials. The baseline study visit will include a physical exam and elicitation of medical history symptoms lifestyle and functional characteristics and psychosocial status. We will recruit 375 women undergoing coronary angiography for suspected ischemia with no obstructive CAD. All 375 will undergo baseline CMRI imaging and a subgroup of 200 will undergo repeat one-year follow-up CMRI. An additional subgroup of 200 women with no coronary stenosis >20% in any epicardial coronary artery will undergo CRT. Women will be contacted annually to measure outcome of symptoms coronary events and associated costs. Established WISE core laboratories and clinical sites will be used. Documentation of the link between invasive CRT and noninvasive CMRI imaging and the prognostic value of this measure for symptoms and adverse outcomes will provide a platform for clinical trials to test therapeutic interventions in appropriately powered studies. Potential therapeutic trials being planned include anti-ischemia therapies such as ranolazine and dipyridamole as well as novel interventions such as erythropoietin and stem-cell therapy targeting coronary vascular function. Results of the application will provide practicing physicians with the ability to translate these findings to clinical care to improve IHD outcomes in women using a noninvasive assessment strategy.

Many cytogenetic abnormalities have been associated with CDH and evidence is accumulating that many developmental defects can result from small genomic alternations invisible at the cytogenetic level resulting in changes in copy number of contiguous genes.  We hypothesize that in some proportion of cases of birth defects including CDH these genomic alternations may be mosaic and may not be readily detectable by testing lymphocytes in blood.  We propose to identify changes in gene copy number by analyzing diaphragm tissue and other tissue from patients with CDH using genome wide oligonucleotide microarrays to perform high resolution gene copy number assessment.  Our long-term goal is to define a set of novel genomic aberrations important in the etiology of CDH characterize new syndromes associated with CDH and identify new genes implicated in diaphragm development. We believe this information will improve genetic diagnostic methods and provide more accurate clinical prognostic information that can improve genetic counseling. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims:  1) Obtain diaphragm skin blood and when possible amniotic fluid samples from 250 neonates with CDH 100 children with previously repaired CDH and amniotic fluid on 250 cases of fetuses with prenatally diagnosed CDH and their parents for oligonucleotide microarray copy number analysis; 2) Analyze the diaphragm (neonatal) blood (pediatric) or amniotic fluid (prenatal) samples for copy number changes (CNCs) using high density oligonucleotide microarrays filter out benign copy number polymorphisms and determine if CNCs are de novo by comparing parents and offspring and determine tissue mosaicism;  3) Identify recurrent CNCs define the minimal overlapping interval identify all the genes in the minimal interval of the recurrent CNCs and sequence positional/physiologic candidate genes and determine if there are overlapping clinical features among patients that can be used to define a genetic syndrome with associated clinical features and prognostic implications; and 4) Correlate results of genetic analyses and survival to discharge and 2 years of age associated birth defects severity of pulmonary hypertension at 1 and 3 months weight and height at 2 years and Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale at 2 years in cases of neonatal ascertainment.

These individuals have a substantially increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease compared to the general population. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation correlate with cardiovascular mortality in this population. We and others have shown that hemodialysis stimulates the endogenous kallikrein-kinin system. We have also shown that hemodialysis induces a systemic inflammatory response characterized by a doubling in concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. During the last period of this grant we have determined that in addition to stimulating t-PA release bradykinin induces oxidative stress and inflammation in the human forearm vasculature and contributes to the fibrinolytic and inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass a procedure similar to hemodialysis in terms of blood-membrane interactions. In this proposal we build on our prior studies to test the hypothesis that Ang II and bradykinin-stimulated inflammation in the setting of impaired endothelial responses to bradykinin contributes to the risk of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. In Aim 1 we will use a bradykinin BB2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 to test the hypothesis that endogenous bradykinin contributes to both the fibrinolytic and inflammatory responses observed during hemodialysis particularly in individuals treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We propose that the fibrinolytic response to hemodialysis is impaired in patients with documented coronary artery disease. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that ACE inhibition and angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade differ in their effects on fibrinolysis oxidative stress and inflammation during hemodialysis. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that these two classes of drugs also differ in their long-term effects on fibrinolysis oxidative stress and inflammation and on carotid intima-media thickness. We will also determine whether B2 receptor gene polymorphisms impact on fibrinolysis oxidative stress and inflammation in this aim. With a growing prevalence of obesity and diabetes the number of people with chronic kidney disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis is expected to increase. The NIH has prioritized reducing deaths due to cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease as a goal of Healthy People 2010. The proposed studies will help us to understand the mechanisms leading to the increased burden of cardiovascular disease in individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and to develop better pharmacologic strategies to reduce cardiovascular mortality in this high risk patient population.

Our aim is to examine every gene shared by specific pathogenic lineages of S. enterica as being a potential target for positive selection for mutations of a pathoadaptive nature. To do this we will employ comparative genetic analyses of Salmonella isolates adapted to cold- and warm-blooded hosts and among the latter those causing systemic non-systemic and asymptomatic infections. We expect to use 30-40 fully sequenced genomes for the analysis and about the same or a larger number of strain pairs will be resequenced by mutation tiling microarrays. Genetic polymorphisms will be analyzed for a footprint of positive selection. Using additional isolates we will investigate association of the mutational changes with strains from specific habitats or types of infection caused. The pathoadaptive nature of mutations in some of the genetic loci will be examined experimentally using both in vitro and in vivo models. As a result we plan to obtain (i) a map of S. enterica genes targeted for mutations that contribute to the host adaptation and virulence of S. enterica; (ii) a list of naturally-occurring mutations in these genes that likely affect the gene/protein function in a pathoadaptive manner and (iii) a comprehensive phylogenetic history and dynamics model of the evolution of virulence in Salmonella. Narrative. We propose to dissect molecular basis of evolution of virulence of Salmonella strains that cause human infections. We will determine genetic changes that contribute to emergence of Salmonella that are infecting warm-blooded animals and cause typhoid or non-typhoid disease in humans.      ","587173",

Prior findings from national treatment censuses and general population surveys provide a limited inconsistent picture of the variation in treatment access and utilization across racial/ethnic groups. However there are growing indications that the care provided to minority groups tends to be inappropriate relative to their profiles of need. Given the disproportionately high rates of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality in some racial/ethnic groups it is important to assess the magnitude of and factors underlying disparities in access to appropriate treatment. The proposed study brings insights from health services research to bear on these issues by adapting models of treatment-seeking to the longitudinal analysis of multiple outcomes that reflect both the appropriateness of treatment received and end-point remission. The project is based on secondary analyses of the NIAAA's National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) a nationally representative longitudinal survey conducted between 2001 and 2005. Using new techniques for the longitudinal analysis of complex survey data analyses will disentangle the effects of race/ethnicity from important covariates such as severity of need comorbidities and socioeconomic indicators and assess competing explanations for why there exist disparities in treatment utilization. Analyses will document and inventory the extent of racial/ethnic variation in the patterning of alcohol problems and co-occurring drug and psychiatric disorders over time. Then informed by clinical practice guidelines analyses will document racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of appropriate treatment in relation to the severity of need. The Specific Aims thus include: (1) to describe racial/ethnic variation in the need for alcohol treatment services and the persistence of need over time using multiple need indicators; (2) to assess the extent of racial/ethnic disparities in unmet need for services with a particular emphasis on the degree to which services appropriately fit racial/ethnic profiles of need (3) to examine how racial/ethnic disparities in unmet need and access to appropriate care are explained by attitudinal logistical and structural barriers to treatment and (4) to assess the impact of the utilization of appropriate treatment services on racial/ethnic differences in the remission of alcohol problems over time. Relevance This study investigates the degree to which racial/ethnic groups' needs for alcohol services are met with appropriate treatment services based on published clinical guidelines. The project further examines factors that may help to explain disparities in appropriate treatment access and the impact that these disparities have on recovery from alcohol problems. This study will thus help to inform policymaking and treatment planning efforts to reduce inequities in the delivery of alcohol treatment services and to assess the impact of these inequities on the burden of alcohol disorders across different racial/ethnic groups in America.      ","309612",

Similar cardiac events may also occur in humans exposed to stress. Cardiac changes have been thought to be due to enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous system as a result of central lesions but absence of an animal model has hampered studies of mechanisms that might contribute directly to the cardiac abnormalities. We have found that interrupting the baroreflex in rats by selectively eliminating NTS (nucleus tractus solitarii) neurons that express the NK1 receptor leads to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. A similar outcome followed loss of catecholaminergic neurons in NTS. At post mortem examination we have identified diffuse microscopic areas of myocardial damage. That damage is similar to findings in humans who have sustained central lesions. Each of the cardiac findings has occurred in chronically instrumented animals housed alone without stressful stimuli; yet each animal that died (approximately 30% died suddenly) did so at night during their period of maximum daily activity. Therefore we seek here to test the hypothesis: eliminating NTS neurons that express NK1 receptors or that synthesize catecholamines promotes lability of arterial blood pressure and through augmented sympathetic nerve activity leads to myocardial damage and damage to cardiac nodal tissue with a predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias and death in animals exposed to stressful events (air jet stress paradigm). In preliminary studies we found that interrupting the baroreflex led to a marked reduction in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) the neuronal enzyme that is critical for synthesis of nitric oxide within the stellate ganglia the source of sympathetic ganglionic innervation to the heart. In that nitric oxide may modulate sympathetic effects on the heart we propose that this reduction in nNOS contributes to the cardiac abnormalities seen in our experimental animal model and may do so likewise in humans. The proposed study will define the relationship between sympathetic nerve activity cardiac damage and cardiac arrhythmias; how stress may augment the deleterious effects of excess sympathetic nerve activity; how nitric oxide in the sympathetic pathways to the heart may contribute to cardiac damage; and how modulating expression of an enzyme involved in synthesis of nitric oxide may affect the process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will identify mechanisms that contribute to cardiac damage cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death in an animal model with a lesion in the central nervous system. Further it will determine if modifying those mechanisms influences the deleterious outcomes which are also well recognized in humans with CNS disease and in humans exposed to profound stress. Therefore the studies could lead to translational clinical studies of treatments aimed at those mechanisms and thus at a major source of morbidity and mortality in affected humans.      ","375000",

The resulting electrochemical gradients act as a battery to power a membrane-based motor in the outer hair cell. The motor differs from other biological motors because it converts a difference in electrical potential directly into a mechanical force rather than utilizing chemical energy stored within cells. As a result it can generate force at very high frequencies and the outer hair cell uses its ""electric motor"" to enhance the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of hearing. The goal of our multidisciplinary team is to understand the biological and physical basis of the outer hair cell motor at the molecular and cellular level. The mechanism resides in the cell's novel lateral wall a 100 nanometer thick three-layer structure composed of two membranes with a cytoskeletal network sandwiched between them. Optimal performance of the motor requires the membrane protein prestin intracellular chloride low membrane cholesterol and an intact lateral wall. The specific objectives of this project period are to evaluate each of these features. Prestin belongs to a family of membrane proteins that facilitate the movement of anions (negatively charged ions such as chloride) through the cell membrane. The structure and function of prestin are analyzed and the contributions of the lateral wall membranes to the modulation and maintenance of the electrochemical gradients necessary for cell function are examined. Coordinated theoretical and experimental approaches are used to identify how prestin works together with anions other membrane components (including cholesterol) and membrane reactive agents (such as quinine) to modulate the movement of electrical charge into and out of the membrane. Molecular and cellular biology bioinformatics biophysics neuroscience chemical physics and bioengineering approaches will all be used. These studies will reveal the frequency response of the motor and show how sound is amplified at high frequencies in the inner ear. Understanding prestin function will provide new information on the anion transport properties of its close family members which are implicated in diseases associated with anion homeostasis within the lung pancreas kidney colon and inner ear. Elucidation of the biological and physical principles underlying the outer hair cell motor will contribute to the emerging field of biological nanotechnology. These studies may lead to improved therapeutic interventions for the hearing impaired. The studies are directly applicable to understanding why deafness follows the loss of outer hair cells; our results will explain how inner ear vibrations are enhanced at high frequencies to improve hearing.

One objective of the proposed research is to determine if a continuous oral contraceptive (OC) regimen that eliminates the pill free interval (PFI) and produces stable low endogenous hormone levels will prevent the expression of PMDD symptoms. A second objective is to demonstrate that changing hormones trigger affective symptoms in PMDD and to establish which gonadal hormones and their neuroactive metabolites are associated with symptoms. Eighty one women with prospectively confirmed PMDD will be randomized and complete one of three 13 week treatment arms: Treatment #1) continuous administration of 20 ug ethinyl estradiol/3mg drospirenone [EE/P]; Treatment #2) interrupted EE/P substituting placebo for EE/DRP during weeks 4 8 & 12; Treatment #3) continuous placebo. The primary outcome measure will be the total PMDD symptom score assessed daily at baseline and throughout the treatments. Secondary measures will include Response Rate mood and social adjustment scales. Serum levels of estradiol (E2) and P as well as plasma levels of neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone allotetrahydroDOC pregnanolone and pregnenolone sulfate all potent modulators of the GABAA receptor will be sampled on cycle days 17 21 25 2 & 5 at pretreatment and also during treatment month 3. Primary predictions are: 1) Continuous EE/P (arm #1) will be associated with a significant reduction in PMDD symptoms relative to pretreatment levels and will be associated with lower symptom levels in months 2 and 3 of treatment relative to both placebo and interrupted EE/P (arms #2 and #3); 2) Women treated with interrupted OC (arm #2) will show symptom severity similar to women treated with placebo (arm #3) and will continue to show cyclicity of symptoms though there will be a shift in peak symptoms to the follicular phase corresponding primarily to the changes in E2 induced during the PFI; 3) the increase in E2 during the PFI in women treated with interrupted OC (arm #2) will predict the development and severity of symptoms in that group; and 4) since OCs suppress the synthesis of neurosteroids the magnitude of the change in neuroactive steroids from days 17 - 25 to days 2- 5 will predict PMDD symptoms in the placebo group but not in the women treated with OCs (arms #1 and #2). The results of this study are expected to advance our knowledge on the pathophysiology of PMDD and help illuminate a substrate for affective dysregulation in women. Confirmation of the role of hormonal change in precipitating PMDD will suggest therapeutic targets for future research.      ","477663",

Preliminary studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that a diet completely devoid of carbohydrates can slow in vivo prostate cancer growth and appears to act via the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis.  Recent data from others suggests that resveratrol a natural phytochemical found in red wine can slow tumor growth via the same mechanism. We hypothesize that the combination of carbohydrate restriction plus resveratrol  both acting via IGF-axis inhibition can a ct together to delay prostate cancer growth. To test this hypothesis we will pursue the following course of study: 1) determine the amount of carbohydrate restriction needed to maximally delay prostate cancer growth; 2) eucidate the role of resveratrol in delaying prostate cancer growth and determine the dose which maximally delays tumor growth; and 3) explore the combined effects of carbohydrate restriction and resveratrol supplementation relative to treatment with a Western diet. We believe these studies will better elucidate the role of carbohydrate restriction and resveratrol in modulating in vivo prostate cancer growth and will lay the solid foundation for future preclinical studies for men with prostate cancer.     PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Prostate cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among men in the United States. In this proposal we aim to develop novel non-toxic complementary treatments aimed at slowing prostate cancer progression: dietary modification and phytopharmaceuticals. If these pre-clinical studies are successful this will lay a solid foundation for future clinical studies among men with prostate cancer which eventually stand the possibility of radically altering and improving care for men with prostate cancer.      ","309798",

Not surprisingly the impact of ncRNA function on human health and disease is proving to be broad and substantial. Most non-coding RNAs assemble with partner proteins to form non-coding RNA-protein complexes (ncRNPs) and these function in diverse cellular processes. The major objective of this proposal is to obtain a detailed understanding of the biogenesis and function of two distinct and important classes of ncRNPs through biochemical and molecular analysis. Our first aim is to determine how the four essential proteins and guide RNA of the H/ACA RNP assemble and function together to carry out RNA modification. In humans H/ACA RNPs are required for the production of the pre-mRNA splicing and protein translation machinery as well as for genome stability. Our work on this complex has provided new insight into the etiology of dyskerotosis congenita. The experiments proposed in our second aim will provide substantial information on the biogenesis and function of a newly recognized prokaryotic genome defense system. This pathway is strongly implicated in defense against viruses and other mobile genetic elements in prokaryotes including important human pathogens. This system represents a major new RNA silencing pathway with the potential to provide insight on other silencing pathways. Importantly this pathway may provide a means for both experimental gene silencing and development of novel classes of therapeutics effective in the broad range of prokaryotes in which the system is found. Together the proposed studies have great potential for significant contributions to human health and disease.       ","305943",

Earlier studies focused on the role of the Cadependent proteases to explain loss of contractile proteins during myocardial ischemia. Very little is known about the role that proteasome plays in removal of proteins damaged by oxidative stress produced by exposure of the heart to ischemia. Given the major role that proteasome plays in protein quality control and removal of oxidized/damaged proteins it seems reasonable to suggest that one consequence of proteasome dysfunction during myocardial ischemia is failure to remove these damaged proteins resulting in cardiomyocyte dysfunction. A project is proposed to examine the hypothesis that removal of proteins damaged during myocardial ischemia is an integral function of proteasome and necessary for recovery of myocardial function. Specific Aim 1 examines the hypothesis that proteasome plays an integral role in the turnover and removal of damaged/oxidized contractile proteins in cardiomyocytes. Using cultured rat neonatal ventricular myocytes (RNVCs) and adult cardiomyocytes (AC) turnover of actin and other oxidized proteins will be examined during exposure to an oxidizing environment. Studies using pharmacologic inhibitors or gene silencing techniques to affect loss of function will determine if loss of oxidized actin or other proteins is mediated by the proteasome. Still other experiments will transfect RNVCs and ACs with replication-deficient adenoviral constructs encoding for a mutated 25 subunit to decrease proteasome activity or with the PA281 subunit of the 11S activator ring to increase proteasome activity. Specific Aim 2 examines the hypothesis that failure of dysfunctional proteasome to remove proteins damaged during myocardial ischemia leads to progressive contractile dysfunction. Experiments will use an in vivo rat LAD occlusion model to determine if a level of postischemic myocardial oxidized proteins correlates with activity of proteasome. Cause and effect between proteasome activity removal of oxidized proteins and recovery of function will be shown by using a transgenic approach to manipulate proteasome activity. Murine transgenic models expressing a mutated 25 subunit with 40% less constitutive chymotryptic activity or overexpressing the PA281 subunit of the 11S activator ring will be used to assess the effect of diminished or increased proteasome activity respectively. Additional studies will examine the hypothesis that a consequence of ischemic preconditioning is preservation of postischemic proteasome activity which facilitates removal of damaged proteins. Specific Aim 3 examines the proteasome configuration responsible for clearing damaged proteins and will use RNAi to target specific subunits of the 20S proteasome 11S activator ring or 19S regulatory particle. These studies will yield new information on the role of the proteasome in removing proteins damaged during myocardial ischemia and aid in the development of new strategies or treatments to increase or preserve proteasome function to mitigate postischemic cardiac injury and prevent progression to failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  AHA statistics indicate that over 70000000 Americans suffer from some form of cardiovascular disease and of these 13000000 have some form of coronary artery disease. These studies will yield new information on the role of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System in regulating processes that may determine cardiomyocyte death such as removal of critical proteins that may have been damaged during a heart attack. Failure to remove these damaged proteins may present a significant stress to the heart that may contribute to the development of heart failure. It is expected that these studies will aid in the development of new strategies or treatments for preservation of proteasome function such as genetic manipulation to increase proteasome function to prevent progression to heart failure.      ","400292",

This area of research is particularly important due to the increasing rate of overweight and its sequelae among children which impact minority and disadvantaged populations disproportionately. The aims of this application are: 1. To test the hypothesis that exercise training per se can improve executive function. Sedentary overweight children will be randomly assigned to the after-school exercise program (40 min/d aerobic exercise over 8 mos) vs. an attention control (placebo) condition to isolate the effects of exercise. Executive function measurement approaches will include a psychometric evaluation a neuropsychological test and behavior ratings. 2. To determine whether observable changes in brain function result from the exercise training. The experimental hypothesis is that exercise training in sedentary overweight children will result in changes in the neural circuitry supporting executive functioning during executive function tasks as compared to children assigned to the attention control condition. Additional analyses will include tests of exercise effects on achievement and possible mediation by executive function; relationships among outcome measures; and planned subgroup analyses to test interactions of age race and gender with group assignment to assess generalizability of results. Intervention effects will also be evaluated at one-year follow-up. This line of research may have important implications for cognitive development trajectories in children that may affect their long-term achievement. This research program aims to provide evidence to strengthen the basis for policy decisions relating to children's health and education during a childhood obesity epidemic.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research focuses on overweight sedentary children whose health cognition and academic performance are therefore at risk and who may be particularly responsive to exercise interventions. This study will determine whether regular exercise per se (i.e. compared to attention control or placebo condition) benefits children's cognition and achievement and will provide insight into neural mechanisms. Provision of comprehensive evidence for the benefits of exercise on children's cognition and achievement may reduce barriers to vigorous physical activity programs during a childhood obesity epidemic by persuading policymakers schools and communities that time spent in physical activity enhances rather than detracts from learning.      ","728968",

The etiology(ies) of autism are currently unknown. However evidence suggests that maternal autoantibodies directed against fetal brain tissue are a putative cause for a subset of autism cases. In support of this we have recently identified a characteristic pattern of autoantibody production to human fetal brain tissue (and to rhesus monkey brain tissue) in 20% of mothers of multiple children with autism. Our preliminary studies indicate that rhesus monkeys prenatally exposed to IgG class antibodies from these mothers produce more whole body motor stereotypies (a defining symptom of autism) compared to control monkeys. These preliminary findings while striking are based on a small number of treated subjects a restricted window of exposure to the purified IgG and a relatively limited period of behavioral observations. It is possible that extending the duration of IgG exposure may result in other behavioral abnormalities more indicative of the complete autistic syndrome. We propose to replicate and extend our research on this promising immunological model of autism by increasing the number of experimental subjects and increasing the duration of IgG exposure into the second trimester for a subset of the experimental subjects. We will enhance and extend the behavioral observations of the treated animals and carry out a structural neuroimaging study. We propose first to conduct an extensive behavioral assessment of the subjects during the first two years of development. We will quantitatively analyze the emergence of species typical behaviors in a variety of social contexts and in experiments designed to probe attachment social dominance social motivation and fear reactions. These studies will also evaluate the quality of transactional interactions and detect abnormal behaviors such as stereotypies. We will also carry out a detailed longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to evaluate differences in the time course of brain development. We will focus the MRI analyses on brain regions most commonly implicated in the neuropathology of autism including the frontal lobes amygdala and cerebellum and on structures associated with stereotypies such as the basal ganglia. This work represents a promising animal model of autism and may have direct implications for diagnosis prevention and treatment of this disorder. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorders affect 1:150 children in the United State though the cause(s) are unknown. This project is designed to provide additional support for the hypothesis that abnormal maternal autoantibodies may be one cause of autism. If maternal autoantibodies are identified as a risk factor for autism this finding would quickly lead both to the development of a diagnostic assay for maternal autoantibodies and to the development of therapeutic interventions to diminish this autism risk factor.      ","727322",

These cells are unusually metabolically active and hypersensitive to damage from overstimulation some therapeutic drugs and environmental toxins and aging. However there is enormous variability in structural and functional outcomes of these challenges to the inner ear among both humans and laboratory animals and a large number of mutations either directly influence the viability of hair cells or alter susceptibility to ototoxicity. The goals of the research program proposed herein are: A) to better define the cellular and molecular cascades that control hair cell death and survival following exposure to potentially ototoxic agents; B) to use the genetic potential of the zebrafish and the accessibility of the lateral line neuromasts to identify and characterize genes that influence the viability of hair cells when challenged by ototoxic agents; and C) to employ the lateral line system to rapidly screen for small molecules/drugs that protect against damage. Four groups of experiments are proposed: 1) We will molecularly characterize 5 already identified mutations that confer resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics; 2) We will identify distinct pathways resulting in hair cell death using chemical and genetic modifiers of hair cell death; 3) We will screen for new genes and drugs that alter the response to aminoglycosides; and 4) We will determine to what degree our findings from the zebrafish lateral line system extend to mammalian systems. In the US over 31 million adults have trouble hearing. Our research will reveal how the sound-sensing cells of the ear are damaged identify genes that may underlie the variability in hearing loss and find drugs that may help in its prevention.      ","489428",

Resistance to chloroquine (CQ) has led to a current emphasis on artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) which combine a highly potent but short-lived artemisinin derivative with a less potent but longer-lasting partner drug. Remarkably ACT regimens have been selected empirically and the contribution of PK/PD properties to ACT treatment outcomes has been largely understudied. Here we propose a systematic analysis of PK/PD properties of antimalarial combinations and their relationship to treatment outcome and parasite resistance. In Aim 1 we will study ACTs. In vitro studies with P. falciparum will define potencies rates of action and drug-drug interactions with ACT agents. We will assess in vivo PK/PD properties in a P. berghei BALB/c mouse model to identify optimal combinations and dosing regimens of existing ACTs and search for improved combinations. ACTs will be evaluated in models of primary infections and re-infections with a drug-sensitive strain. PK/PD relationships will include comparisons of parasite response to drug (parasite clearance times rates of recrudescence survival) and drug exposure profiles (drug plasma levels including Cmax concentration-time functions (AUC) time above minimum inhibitory concentrations). In Aim 2 PK/PD relationships will be determined for existing ACTs as well as novel combinations identified in Aim 1 in primary infection and re-infection models against drug-resistant lines of P. berghei. These include lines that have acquired stable resistance to partner drugs or that are transiently resistant to artemisinins. We will also exploit a model of P. falciparum propagation in NODscid/2m-/- mice to assess in vivo efficacy against artemisinin and CQ-resistant P. falciparum. Resistance and toxicity concerns with ACTs make it necessary to consider alternative antimalarial combination therapies. Based on recent findings from Malawi we propose that CQ may again be useful if combined agents effective against CQ-resistant parasites. In Aim 3 we propose PK/PD studies to evaluate several candidate CQ-containing combinations. This will employ a CQ-resistant line of P. berghei in BALB/c mice as well as the P. falciparum NODscid/2m-/- mouse model to define whether these combinations can successfully treat multidrug resistant parasites and define PK/PD correlates of treatment outcome. This aim will also use the BALB/c model to define the contribution of immunity. These studies should substantially enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between antimalarial pharmacology treatment outcome and the emergence of resistance and provide robust data to guide the selection and optimization of antimalarial combinations to effectively treat and suppress drug- resistant malaria. This R01 grant application proposes to study the pharmacological properties of antimalarial drugs in clinical use. These properties will be assessed with human and rodent malaria parasites and will use mouse malaria models to identify pharmacological/ pharmacodynamic correlates of treatment outcome. These data will identify drug combinations and treatment regimens that reduce the emergence of drug resistant malaria which poses a substantial burden on public health in tropical countries.      ","579356",

Although there are a number of indirect and direct methods to assess physical activity and energy expenditure all current methods have serious well-documented shortcomings vis-`a-vis application to free-living individuals. Recent research has shown that the most practical objective method for measuring physical activity in free-living individuals is the use of portable activity monitors that are based on the joint monitoring of heart rate and accelerometry. Under R21 grant funding the proposing team developed and evaluated a novel Physical Activity Monitor (the PAM-R21) for use in estimating both energy expenditure and the time spent at different activity intensity levels (e.g. sedentary/light moderate vigorous). Using heart rate and triaxial accelerometry the PAM-R21 which uses artificial neural networks to convert heart rate and triaxial accelerometer data into estimates of energy expenditure outperformed the only commercially-available integrated heart rate/acceleration activity monitor (viz. Actiheart) in terms of estimated energy expenditure activity intensity level and heart rate. The research proposed herein will leverage the previously-developed PAM-R21 to create and validate a low-profile next-generation PAM-R01 monitor; validity and reliability testing will be performed in diverse populations that will include children adults and seniors. The PAM-R01 will also be compared with existing activity monitors in both structured and simulated free-living activities across a broad range of physical activity intensities including the transitional periods between activities. The PAM-R01 will be small lightweight and unobtrusive and will have wireless transmission capabilities; it represents an important step in the advancement of effective accurate measurement of physical activity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Physical activity is an important behavior that is related to reduce risk of a large number of negative health outcomes. However the prevalence of physical inactivity remains unacceptably high; reducing the prevalence of inactivity is therefore a major focus of public health initiatives. The proposed development of the PAM- R01 activity monitor has the potential to remove one significant barrier that restricts research on the health effects of activity: the lack of an accurate unobtrusive and inexpensive device for measuring physical activity in free-living individuals. It also has strong potential for application in other areas such as gait studies pain management and geriatric stability assessment and fall monitoring.      ","452531",

Animal studies have shown that a tubing template implanted into the peritoneal cavity becomes covered with tissue and this newly formed tissue tube can be used as a vascular graft. However due to the nature of animal models used it is difficult to investigate the development of this tissue at the cellular/molecular level. To understand this mechanism we have developed a mouse model where the newly formed vessels were transplanted into the abdominal aortae of the same mice in which they were grown. These grafts remained patent for at least 4 months and in situ they developed the architecture of normal blood vessels. Comprehensive genotypic and phenotypic analysis revealed that the mouse tissue capsule cells and peritoneal cells have the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells including the expression of transcription factors that are specific to stem cells the presence of side population cells as well as Lin-/Sca-1+/c-kit+ cells. Functional analyses revealed that these peritoneal cells are biologically active as shown by their ability to: stimulate re-perfusion/neovascularization of ischemic hind limb; repopulate the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice; and graft into various organ of recipient mice. We propose to: 1) Determine the contribution of peritoneal-derived stem cells to generation of tissue capsule; 2) D Determine the role of peritoneal-derived stem cells in the remodeling of capsule graft; Aim 3) Determine functionality of peritoneal stem cell sub-population. Accomplishing these Specific Aims will elucidate the mechanisms by which peritoneal cells contribute to the development of bioengineered tissues and may lead to the development of novel strategies for tissue bioengineering and reperfusion of a variety of ischemic tissues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vascular bypass grafting is the mainstay of revascularization for ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease and in the US alone 1.4 million arterial bypass operations are performed annually. However 30% of patients who require arterial bypass procedures have no suitable autologous arteries or veins for use. In animal models it has been shown that tubular structures can be grown in the peritoneal cavity and that they can function as autologous graft while undergoing extensive remodeling to resemble native vessels. The mechanisms for this process of tissue generation and subsequent remodeling have been have been poorly understood due to the animals species used thus far; however by using our mouse model in the proposed studies we shall elucidate these mechanisms at a cell and molecular level which will in turn have significant implications for our ability to treat ischemic vascular diseases.      ","406250",

Despite the great scientific and public health significance of this question the mechanisms underlying the surge in depression and emergence of gender differences in depression during adolescence remain elusive. This application is relevant to NIMH's mission to understand the causes of depression in youth role of minority and gender status in depression and targets for early intervention. The aims of this application are to examine the generality to African-Americans of this surge in depression and emergence of gender differences as well as to examine the mechanisms underlying these developmental phenomena from the perspective of an innovative genetic-cognitive vulnerability X transactional stress model embedded within a normative adolescent brain and cognitive development context. To this end a large-scale prospective longitudinal study of 600 12-year old community youth (evenly divided between males and females and Caucasians and African-Americans) and their parents will be conducted. Assessments of children's cognitive and genetic (serotonin transporter gene polymorphism; Year 2 only) vulnerability normative cognitive development racial identity and psychiatric diagnoses will be conducted at Time 1 and yearly thereafter. Assessments of psychiatric symptoms negative life events hopelessness emotional abuse and peer victimization perceived discrimination body image and pubertal status will occur every 6 months. In addition assessments of parental psychopathology and parental cognitive vulnerability will be obtained from Ps' mothers at Time 1. Finally information about parenting styles and parental inferential feedback will be obtained from Ps' mothers at Time 1 and yearly. Results will have very significant implications for prevention of depression. Knowledge of mechanisms underlying the adolescent surge in depression would suggest interventions for short-circuiting it and the great impairment it portends for young adulthood. Specifically results will suggest optimal features of preventive interventions for depression in youth regarding: identification of youth to target timing psychological or biological processes to target and interventions for girls vs. boys and African-Americans vs. Caucasians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is unique in that it will provide a major prospective study of the generality across ethnic groups of the adolescent surge in depression and emergence of gender differences and test mechanisms underlying these two developmental phenomena from the perspective of an integrated cognitive vulnerability-stress/genetic vulnerability- stress model. In addition developmental trajectories of executive functions relevant to the genesis of cognitive vulnerability to depression informed by knowledge of normative adolescent brain and cognitive development will be examined. By isolating the risk factors and mechanisms underlying the development of depression in adolescence the project's findings will have significant implications for the prevention of depression particularly in the area of optimal timing and targeting (i.e. high cognitive and/or genetic risk) of interventions that could be tailored appropriately to address gender and ethnic differences.      ","659988",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) an endotoxic component of gram negative bacteria initiates an inflammatory cascade that contributes to multiple organ injury. Under inflammatory conditions monocytes infiltrate the artery wall and differentiate to either dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages (MF). Sepsis induces dysregulation of the innate immune response and changes in lipid metabolism leading to an increase in triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins and a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in plasma. HDL and its major protein component apolipoprotein (apo) A-I exert prominent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects and reduces injury responses associated with leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall. Recently there has been considerable interest in using HDL as a novel therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases like sepsis. Although the mechanism of HDL action is not well understood improving HDL quality/function may favorably influence the pathogenic response to sepsis. Recent studies from our laboratory show that a novel 18-residue peptide (4F) whose design is based on the structural features of apoA-I converts HDL from a dysfunctional to functional HDL form. 4F favors the formation of HDL particles enriched in apoA-I and paraoxanase-1 (PON1)/PAF-acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) enzymes that scavenge oxidized lipids and PAF. Exciting preliminary data show that 4F inhibits inflammation and cytotoxicity in both a rodent model of sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture model) and cell culture systems. In addition it also plays a role in the differentiation of monocytes to DCs. 4F (like apoA-I) modulates monocyte/MF function and has potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on pilot data we hypothesize that 4F: (1) reduces vascular injury by inhibiting the association/binding of monocytes to ECs and/or their cytotoxic actions; and (2) improves the immune response by preferentially inducing the differentiation of monocyte/MF to DCs. It is further proposed that these effects are mediated both directly by the peptide and indirectly by improving HDL quality/function. To test these hypotheses we propose the following specific aims: (1) to assess 4F-mediated changes in the quality/function of apo A-I and apoB-containing lipoproteins in a rodent model of sepsis (2) to determine whether anti-inflammatory mechanisms of 4F action in cell culture models are due to improvement in lipoprotein quality/function and/or direct protective effects of the peptide and (3) to determine whether 4F improves the immune response to sepsis by enhancing the formation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This proposal explores the role of apoA-I/HDL in the modulation of monocyte/MF function in the context of sepsis. Results of the proposed studies will provide new pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of sepsis and other pathological states characterized by reduced plasma HDL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Sepsis is a major cause of death in hospitalized patients. Mortality is due in large part to the cellular injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In this application we propose to investigate whether the synthetic peptide 4F which mimics the protective effects of HDL cholesterol reduces inflammatory injury associated with sepsis. We hypothesize that this peptide exerts protective effects by stimulating the formation of new HDL particles with improved function and by direct effects on cells. Collectively these effects serve to reduce cell injury induced by sepsis.      ","267634",

Most prevalent in the elderly AF is associated with a 2-fold higher risk for mortality. AF is the most potent risk factor for stroke in the elderly and the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke. Despite intensive study AF treatment options remain suboptimal. Recent data support the hereditability of AF and suggest a complex genetic basis for common AF. Identification of genes that increase risk for AF may have important clinical applicability. The overall goal of our research program is to perform an unbiased whole genome association study to identify genetic variants associated with AF and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of AF. This will promote the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention and/or diagnostic tests to predict and potentially prevent AF. DNA will be derived from AF patient and control samples collected in DNA/blood/tissue banks at the Cleveland Clinic and collaborating institutions. Our initial case cohort will be comprised of subjects with Lone AF (AF without coronary valvular or other structural heart disease) a tightly defined and much more homogeneous phenotype than previously studied mixed etiology AF populations and likely to have the most direct genetic associations. Using microarray technology 550000 specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be assessed in each of 600 lone AF subjects 300 matched heart disease-free control subjects and 1800 publicly accessible genotyped population controls. We will perform multivariate logistic regression to identify the top SNPs associated with AF for subsequent validation. These SNPs will be validated in a 1536 SNP custom genotyping assay performed with an independent population of 600 subjects with early onset AF (meeting criteria for lone AF) and 600 disease-free population controls. Because most patients with AF have some form of structural heart disease we will begin to extend the 1536 SNP analysis to other AF subjects with structural heart disease specifically well-defined coronary artery disease. We will analyze groups separately as well as jointly pooling data from the 550K and 1536 SNP assays from all studies and perform multiple regression and novel testing strategies to minimize population stratification in order to identify SNPs significantly associated with lone AF and AF with heart disease. We will resequence the genes in the vicinity of the top 4 highly AF-associated SNPs in 48 patients to identify new variations gain insight into AF-associated haplotypes and potentially identify causative variations that could cause changes in protein function or expression levels. We will also evaluate the prevalence of copy number variations in lone AF as well as somatic mutations and copy number variations in atrial tissue from a subset of patients with AF. Future benefits of these studies include increased understanding of the mechanisms of AF pathogenesis and the potential ability to develop personalized gene-specific diagnostic tests and drugs that will aid in predicting preventing and treating AF and its associated risks for stroke. Project Narrative: Atrial fibrillation (AF) afflicts more than 2.3 million Americans and is associated with a 2-fold higher risk for mortality and a 5-7 fold increased risk of stroke making AF one of the most potent risk factors for stroke in the elderly and the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke. Despite intensive study for the past decade AF treatment options remain suboptimal. Future benefits of the proposed studies to identify genetic variants that increase risk for AF include increased understanding of the mechanisms of AF pathogenesis and the potential ability to develop personalized gene-specific diagnostic tests and drugs that will aid in predicting preventing and treating AF and its associated risk for stroke.      ","784998",

Brain imaging studies show amygdala changes in patients with these disorders. The present studies use a multifaceted approach to elucidate how amygdalar opioid systems regulate anxiety and fear-related processes. These studies will enhance our understanding of amygdala circuits that control distinct aspects of anxiety and fear by comparing several anxiety-evoking stimuli and elucidate the specific role of mu opioid receptors (MOR) in these different responses. Since our previous studies suggested that mu opioid receptors (MOR) and enkephalin in the amygdala can modulate basal anxiety responses and the actions of benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs the proposed studies will examine how MOR receptors modulate amygdalar circuitry to alter these anxiety-related responses. We hypothesize that distinct neuronal circuits are activated by different conditioned and unconditioned anxiety-evoking situations and that presynaptic MOR receptors localized in specific amygdalar neurocircuits regulate changes in amygdala glutamate and GABA release to shift anxiety-related responses in a context-dependent manner. Four anxiety-evoking tests including the elevated plus maze (unpredictable threat) predator odor-induced defensive burying (specific threat) restraint stress (psychogenic stimulus) and cue- conditioned freezing (learned fear) will be compared in these studies. Aim 1 uses virus-mediated gene transfer to examine if decreasing the expression of MOR in the amygdala alters anxiety-related behaviors and/or endocrine responses to restraint stress and if selectively targeting these decreases to pyramidal neurons of the basolateral amygdala produces the same effects. Aim 2 uses cFos immunoreactivity to compare the cellular phenotype(s) activated by distinct anxiety-evoking situations the localization of MOR in these activated neuron populations and if activation patterns are altered by decreasing amygdala MOR expression. Aim 3 uses in vivo microdialysis in the amygdala to assess 1) if MOR activation alters GABA or glutamate efflux 2) if anxiety-evoking situations induce release of enkephalin GABA or glutamate and 3) if decreasing MOR expression modifies MOR-induced or anxiety-induced release of GABA or glutamate. The studies will enhance our understanding of how the amygdala and the opioid system regulate anxiety responses and could provide novel therapeutic strategies for treating affective and anxiety-related disorders. Since opioid systems in the amygdala are modified during chronic pain states and altered by drugs of abuse the results of these studies will also enhance our understanding of the neural basis of heightened anxiety states seen in chronic pain patients or during withdrawal from opiates benzodiazepines and alcohol. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness and affect more than19 million US adults yet our understanding of these disorders and the drugs used to treat them remains limited. The present studies use animal models to elucidate how the circuitry in the brain region underlying emotional behaviors namely the amygdala controls responses in three different anxiety-evoking situations. The focus on endogenous morphine-like chemicals (opioids) could lead to new treatment strategies for anxiety disorders and increase our understanding of why chronic pain states or withdrawal from prescribed or abused opioid drugs lead to increased anxiety.      ","316552",

These family behavior changes occurred in a context of major structural changes in the economy education and other institutions along with changes in the attitudes of individuals towards many components of what had been the traditional family institution. The implications of these changes have been profound for both the family system (e.g. children growing up in single parent families) and other institutions (e.g. the link between low fertility and old- age support systems). The changes in family behavior have been well documented but the processes that led to such dramatic changes are still not well understood. Building upon an existing cross-sectional data set the proposed research will collect and build a data set that is specifically designed to address the interplay of structural societal change individual behavior and attitudes and the emergence of an altered family institution in a country Japan where many of these family behavior changes began recently thus affording a chance to examine the processes that facilitate broad-scale family behavior change. After a series of theoretically informed descriptive analyses we conduct a series of statistical analyses using first difference and instrumental variables models examining changes in attitudes towards non-traditional family behaviors as well as changes in marital happiness and fertility intentions. Based on prior work suggesting that cohabitation is the linchpin in family change in Japan using a reduced form random effects hazard model we examine the age pattern of cohabitation and differentials in the probability of cohabiting.

We have shown that this post-translational modification occurs in trypanosomatids and malaria parasites that cause devastating tropical diseases. We have also shown that the enzyme that attaches farnesyl groups to parasite proteins protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) is a good target for the development of novel drugs that irreversibly inhibit the growth of the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei) and malaria (Plasmodium falciparum). We have made considerable progress in the design and discovery of potent inhibitors of parasite PFTs that block the growth of parasites in culture and also cure experimental rodents infected with parasites. However our best compounds are not good enough to advance into clinical trials because they are metabolized too quickly to allow for once or twice daily dosing over a 3-day period a dose schedule that is optimal for treatment of tropical diseases. We want to continue to apply the principles of structure-guided medicinal chemistry to improve the drug-like properties of our PFT inhibitors. In vitro assessment of drug metabolism and intestinal absorption will be used to screen potent PFT inhibitors. Our best compounds will be further explored for efficacy in parasite- infected rodents. Our overall goal is to develop new drugs for the treatment of parasitic diseases that cause suffering among millions of people worldwide. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of our work is to discover new therapeutics for the treatment of the devastating tropical diseases malaria and African sleeping sickness. Malaria and African sleeping sickness kill about 2 million and 200000 people respectively each year. New drugs are needed because existing drugs are either ineffective or resistance has developed.      ","597282",

Although warfarin is highly efficacious when used correctly it is also associated with high adverse event rates and lost efficacy due to poor control of anticoaguation levels. Even in specialized anticoagulation clinics that are devoted to monitoring patients on warfarin 32% to 68% of patient time is spent out of the target therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) range putting patients at increased risk for thromboembolism (TE) from under-anticoagulation and bleeding from over-anticoagulation. One of the primary modifiable contributors to poor anticoaguation control is non-adherence to warfarin. The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two novel approaches that aim to improve anticoaguation control by increasing warfarin adherence informed by two recently completed NIH-funded studies. Both financial incentives and electronic pill reminder/feedback systems have been used successfully to modify health behaviors in a variety of health contexts. This application is for a 4-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which participants receive either a lottery-based daily financial incentive; a customized transtelephonic electronic pillbox reminder and feedback system at home; both the lottery and the electronic reminder and feedback system; or usual care (the electronic pillbox used only as a recording device with all reminders and feedback disabled). The primary specific aims will be to: 1) assess the effectiveness of a lottery-based financial incentive -- with participants eligible each day they take their medication -- on anticoagulation control relative to the control group over 6 months; 2) assess the effectiveness of a customized electronic reminder and feedback system on anticoagulation control relative to the control group over 6 months; and 3) assess the joint effectiveness of the lottery-based financial incentives and electronic reminder system on anticoagulation control relative to the other groups over 6 months. Secondary aims include assessment of the cost-effectiveness of each of the above approaches and evaluation of the impact on adherence measures and other outcomes. The proposed interventions draw on insights from behavioral economic research and are designed to be cost-effective and scalable through the use of easily applied technology. If successful this approach could reduce the number of deaths serious thromboembolic events and adverse drug effects from warfarin by tens of thousands among Americans each year. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Warfarin is a blood thinner that when properly used significantly reduces the likelihood of strokes and other clotting events in millions of patients in the United States. However many patients have difficulty taking their warfarin correctly and therefore are at high risk of strokes other clotting events and bleeding. In this study we are testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two innovative approaches to improving adherence to warfarin which have the potential to reduce substantially the risk of death or significant illness for the millions of Americans for whom warfarin is a critically important medication.      ","800516",

Such a system will allow health care professionals in a point-of-care setting to identify and treat infectious diseases in a timely manner thereby improving patient outcomes and preventing further spread. The project focuses on Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) which can lead to life-threatening infections in newborns and immuno- compromised individuals. A need exists for rapid HSV diagnosis in STD clinics and in maternity wards. The project involves a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in bioassay development engineering and clinical pathology. This team will develop a system which shall be capable of type-common or type-specific HSV detection from swab samples of herpetic lesions (reported to contain on average 8*104 virus particles per mL lysis buffer) with no interference from background human DNA or from other bacterial or viral pathogens associated with orogenital lesions. The system shall employ a disposable and self-contained sample-in answer-out cartridge format that mates to a low cost handheld electronics module to provide ease-of-use and to avoid cross-contamination. The total assay time including sample preparation and detection shall be less than 30 minutes. The project builds on previous work combining novel isothermal DNA amplification reactions with colorimetric detection of oligonucleotides through DNA-functionalized gold nanospheres and on the development of microfluidic systems for biothreat detection. The first aim of this project is to further develop and systematically optimize single- and multiplex assays for rapid sensitive and robust detection of HSV from DNA isolates of clinical samples involving isothermal amplification followed by visual read-out. The second aim is to establish and optimize simple but efficient sample preparation protocols suitable for coupling to the isothermal assays developed under aim 1 to facilitate robust HSV detection from swab samples of herpetic lesions. The third aim focuses on developing device prototypes to execute the sample preparation and isothermal amplification methods developed under aims 1 and 2. This project presents a unique opportunity to bring together multidisciplinary expertise to develop a next generation of assays and analyzers for nucleic acid testing. The envisioned system will enable rapid pathogen detection in point of care settings with the same robustness and sensitivity as current (mostly PCR-based) methods while reducing the cost by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to current benchtop systems for nucleic acid testing at the point of care. In the long term the assays and devices developed herein can be applied to other clinical pathogens including RNA viruses such as HIV and influenza to biothreat detection and to resource-limited settings.       ","606729",

These microorganisms pose a potentially significant threat to both dental health care workers and dental patients particularly those who are medically compromised or immunocompromised. The long-range goal of this project is to use N-halamine- based rechargeable antimicrobial tubing to control the formation of dental unit waterline biofilms. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) covalently bind ""self-recharging"" N-halamines onto plastic tubing; (2) characterize the mechanical properties antimicrobial activity anti-adherent function and rechargeability of the new tubes; (3) evaluate the biofilm-controlling function and safety of the new tubes in model dental water delivery systems and (4) provide preliminary data on the cost of the new approach. To achieve these goals the first part of the proposed research will optimize the grafting reactions to covalently bind both amide and amine N-halamine precursors into plastic tubing currently used in outpatient dental clinic waterlines so as to introduce self-recharging antimicrobial effects into the tubing and achieve long-lasting biofilm-control (e.g. longer than 1 month). This will be followed by a series of studies to provide detailed information on the mechanical properties antimicrobial/anti-adherent activity rechargeability and effects of recharging on the mechanical properties of the new tubes. Then the new tubes will be evaluated with mixed species of water bacteria in model dental water delivery systems to determine the efficacy and safety of the new approach in controlling DUWL biofilms. Finally the cost of the tubes will be estimated as a first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the new approach. If successful the rechargeable antimicrobial tubing approach will provide an innovative solution to the biofilm problem in dental unit water delivery systems.

We have shown that the osteoclastogenesis needed for resorption of alveolar bone in the coronal region of the bony crypt is regulated by expression of osteoclastogenesis genes in the dental follicle (DF). Similarly we hypothesize that osteo-inductive genes expressed in the DF especially those genes upregulated in the basal one-half of the DF promote tooth eruption by regulating the osteogenesis needed for bone formation that occurs at the base of the alveolar bony crypt. To test this hypothesis gene microarray studies will be done to determine which osteo-inductive genes are upregulated in the DF at the times of maximal bone growth at the base of the socket. Next because surgical removal of the basal one-half of the DF prevents tooth eruption and alveolar bone formation laser capture microdissection coupled with real-time RT-PCR studies will determine which of these osteo-inductive genes are expressed more in the basal portion than in the coronal portion of the DF. Each gene that is upregulated more in the basal portion will then be silenced in vivo using electroporation and RNAi technology specific for the target mRNA of each gene to determine the effect of each gene on eruption times. Regarding osteoclastogenesis secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP-1) a molecule that inhibits osteoclastogenesis is expressed in the DF and it is hypothesized that its gene expression is downregulated by eruption molecules such that osteoclastogenesis can occur. Thus DF cells will be incubated with molecules that promote osteoclastogenesis for eruption to determine which of them down-regulate SFRP-1 expression. Using osteoclast precursor cells we also will determine if SFRP-1 inhibits osteoclastogenesis by down- regulating a cell fusion molecule DC-STAMP. Finally we hypothesize that stem cells present in the DF might contribute to the osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts needed for eruption. To test this stem cells isolated from the DF will be incubated with osteoclast-inducing molecules or with osteo-inductive molecules to determine if the stem cells can form osteoclasts or osteoblasts.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the molecular regulation of the osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis needed for eruption may explain why impacted teeth (e.g. 3rd molars) do not erupt as well as explain the causes of various eruption disorders such as seen in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome. To correct eruption disorders a molecular approach to induce eruption is a long-term goal. Finally because the periodontal ligament (PDL) is derived from the DF the molecular regulation of osteoclastogenesis by the DF may suggest a similar role for the PDL in regulating alveolar bone loss seen in periodontitis.      ","356475",

For this continuation we propose to observe the subjects from 14-17 years. The broad aim is to determine whether prenatal cocaine exposure continues to impact developmental outcome in particular risky behavior. Specific aims are: to determine using our model which controls for effects of neonatal medical risk environmental risk and other prenatal substance exposures on outcomes whether the cocaine effects seen at earlier ages persist particularly for risky behavior; to investigate whether cocaine exposure affects gonadal hormones and pubertal development; to determine whether increased male vulnerability to cocaine continues to be seen in their risky behavior in adolescence; and to test our model on risky behavior in adolescence using longitudinal data analytic techniques such as path modeling linear growth modeling and structural equation modeling. Our model focuses particularly on the mediating effects of earlier inhibitory control attention and emotional regulation deficits on risky behavior and the moderating role of gender and pubertal development. Adolescents and their mothers will be seen once a year to assess these domains of functioning. Measures will include behavioral observations bioassays interviews questionnaires standardized tests and school reports. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowing what these teens are like during mid to late adolescence will provide a window into their adult lives. Having data on adolescent functioning will provide a basis for generating interventions during the teen years that could potentially change the entire life course of these children. Given difficulties of inhibitory control and emotional regulation prenatally cocaine-exposed teens may be especially at risk for adolescent problems that include sexual risk-taking and substance use which potentiate serious health outcomes such as trauma and HIV infection.      ","812361",

While stress responses permit the organism to respond to threats stress responses that are stimulus-inappropriate or prolonged by stressor persistence or increased individual susceptibility to stress are maladaptive. Differences in stress responsiveness are in part genetically determined. The social and physical environments where an individual lives interact with his or her genetic make-up early developmental history adult experiences life style and life experiences to determine his or her ability to cope with stress. The clinical literature suggests that individual differences in stress responses and ability to cope with stressful situations are factors in the likelihood of developing cardiovascular and other illness as well as substance abuse. Psychological distress is also a challenge in the management of chronic diseases like cancer and HIV/AIDS. The hypothesis under test in this proposal is that complex phenotypes like individual differences in stress responsiveness are regulated by specific genetic modules within networks of interacting molecular pathways. To test this hypothesis two collaborative teams headed by two PIs are proposed: The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) team with expertise in behavioral and molecular neurobiology (PI: Pietro P. Sanna) and the Columbia University team of the National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) with expertise in systems biology strategies (PI: Andrea Califano). To model individual differences in stress responses the TSRI team has selectively bred two replicate lines of rats for high (HSR) and low (LSR) stress responses that diverge for their anxiogenic-like responses to stressful environments. We propose to use reverse engineering strategies recently introduced by the Columbia team to identify the neurobiological bases of differential susceptibility to stress using these rat lines. Specifically the present proposal will use the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) and the Modulator Inference by Network DYnamics (MINDy) developed by Dr. Califano at MAGNet. ARACNe is specifically designed to identify gene regulatory networks in large microarray expression datasets and has the ability to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian systems. MINDY is designed to identify post-translational interactions. A map of transcriptional and post-translational interactions that regulate the central stress system processes from HSR- LSR gene expression profile data (Central Stress System Interactome) will be assembled. Biochemical and behavioral approaches will then be used to validate the role of the candidate genetic modules identified in determining differential responsiveness to stress. The present research will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of differential stress responsiveness and will inform new pathogenetic hypotheses of individual differences in stress vulnerability in humans that will be tested in an eventual funding period.     The elucidation of the neurobiological bases of individual vulnerability to stress will require a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks that govern the neuronal pathways involved in the central regulation of the stress system. To investigate such a multi-scale system the present collaborative project will leverage animal models behavioral and other neurobiological expertise of the TSRI team in conjunction with the bioinformatics capabilities of the MAGNet at Columbia University to bring to bear a unique integrated approach. Ultimately it is expected that the results of the present study by elucidating genes that regulate divergent stress responsiveness and the gene networks in which they are active will identify novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets for the prevention and treatment of the detrimental effects of excessive stress on human health.      ","474313",

Osteoarthritis (OA) pain affects half of all adults age 60 or older; the majority of whom also experience significant sleep disturbance. Since pain initiates and exacerbates sleep disturbance and poor sleep in turn maintains and exacerbates chronic pain optimal interventions for OA should target both pain and sleep. While there is limited preliminary evidence that such an intervention may benefit both pain and sleep a large rigorous randomized controlled trial testing this hypothesis is lacking. The proposed study will determine whether an intervention that targets both pain and co-morbid sleep disturbance in older adults with painful OA and disturbed sleep yields substantially improved pain sleep and functional outcomes relative to both an intervention targeting pain alone and a placebo-control. Older (>60 yrs) patients (N=5556 in current database) who have sought treatment for OA in a large health plan will be screened for significant chronic pain and co-morbid sleep disturbance. Three hundred seventy five patients will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: an 8-session Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Pain (CBT-P) program addressing pain dysfunction alone; an 8-session Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Pain and Insomnia (CBT- Principal Investigator) program addressing both pain and sleep disturbance; {or an 8-session Stress Management and Wellness (SMW) placebo-control group. The SMW condition is based on a placebo-control intervention previously demonstrated to have no effect on sleep quality or perceived pain. To control relevant information all three groups (CBT-P CBT-Principal Investigator and SMW) will receive the Arthritis Helpbook which provides information on pain control arthritis self-management and sleep hygiene techniques. Subjects will be assessed at baseline post-treatment (2-months) and at 6 12 and 24-month follow-ups. We hypothesize that: 1) CBT-Principal Investigator will produce significantly greater initial and long-term improvements in sleep outcomes relative to both CBT-P and SMW; 2) CBT-Principal Investigator by improving sleep outcomes will produce significantly greater initial and long-term reductions in OA pain than both CBT-P and SMW; 3) CBT-Principal Investigator by improving both sleep and pain outcomes will produce greater initial and long-term improvements in pain-related activity limitations than both CBP-P and SMW;} and 4) CBT-Principal Investigator by improving sleep pain and functional outcomes will produce long-term reductions in health care utilization and costs for a broad range of symptomatic conditions (including pain and sleep disturbance). The proposed trial will also provide the largest experimental evaluation to date assessing the effectiveness of conventional CBT for OA pain. Given recent limitations on pharmacologic options for management of OA pain the proposed trial has important implications for improving management of both pain and co-morbid sleep disturbance in the rapidly growing population of older Americans with OA.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis (OA) pain debilitates half of all older adults most of whom also experience significant sleep disturbance. This project will determine whether a cognitive-behavioral treatment targeting both pain and co- morbid sleep disturbance in older adults with painful OA results in substantially greater reductions in pain and improvements in sleep and functional outcomes compared to current standards of care. Given the recent limitations on pharmacologic options for effective management of OA pain this project has major implications for improving management of both pain and co-morbid sleep disturbance in the rapidly growing population of older Americans suffering from OA.      ","712768",

Cortical sensory processing has been shown to be highly dynamic with past experience current context and expectations shaping how the world is perceived on a moment by moment basis. Disorders of sensory processing constitute a major component of impairments induced by CNS disease and aging as well as congenital disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. In the olfactory sensory (piriform) cortex diverse stimulus features are synthesized into perceptual wholes through afferent and intrinsic fiber convergence and plasticity allowing familiar odor objects to be remembered. The intrinsic association fiber system in priform cortex is extensive and based on anatomical data and new physiological data supported by an R21 to the co-PI's plays a role in shaping cortical ensemble activity in response to odorant stimuli. Thus our data demonstrate that odorants evoke distributed unit ensemble activity throughout anterior piriform cortex (aPCX) with individual components of the ensemble contributing to multiple odorant representations. In the present proposal which extends the R21-supported research we propose to address three previously untested hypotheses regarding cortical ensemble function in olfaction using multi-electrode array and paired single-unit recording in anesthetized and awake rats. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that cell ensemble membership size and the probability of correlated activity in paired single-units will be greater in the posterior PCX (pPCX) than in aPCX due to the more extensive intrinsic excitatory association fiber system in pPCX. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that manipulations of the neuromodulators ACh and NE to PCX which selectively affect intrinsic fiber synaptic efficacy will modulate ensemble membership size odorant specificity and probability of correlated activity in paired single-units. Finally Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that behavioral state will modulate ensemble size odorant specificity and probability of correlated activity in cell pairs potentially via a cholinergic or noradrenergic mechanism. Together these aims will begin to explore how cortical ensembles merge the myriad odorant features encoded by peripheral circuits into odorant objects and how attention and arousal may modulate odor discrimination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cortical processing of information plays a critical role in sensory perception memory movement and cognition. Thus understanding how circuits within the cortex process information is important for understanding and treating disorders of information processing. This proposal takes advantage of a relatively simple cortical circuit (the piriform cortex) performing relatively complex information processing tasks (odor object discrimination) to explore how groups of neurons work together as an ensemble to interpret sensory input.      ","373833",

This rapid gain modulation is reflected in the change in the number and timing of action potentials. Using the primary visual cortex as a model system we will examine the synaptic and network mechanisms that control the responsiveness of cortical neurons on a moment-to-moment basis with particular attention to naturalistic visual input (natural movies). To understand gain modulation thoroughly we will first investigate the cellular mechanisms of the contrast response function curve as a prototypical example of a cortical input-output relationship. These studies will examine the origins of threshold responsiveness mid-range sensitivity and saturation at high contrast. Once the cellular mechanisms of this prototypical relationship are understood we will then manipulate the membrane potential input conductance and membrane variance of individual visual cortical neurons (as well as stimulate the non-classical receptive field) to determine how these factors affect the contrast response function curve. These gain modulation studies will be complemented with experiments designed to reveal the synaptic mechanisms that control response timing precision and variability. Visual cortical neurons respond to full field natural visual scenes (movies) with temporally precise highly selective and unusually space action potential sequences. These responses are often not well predicted by the linear properties of cells' classical receptive fields. By recording the pattern of excitatory and inhibitory inputs arriving in visual cortical neurons during presentation of natural stimuli we will identify the contributions of excitatory inhibitory and spike initiation properties to spike timing precision. By varying the size of visual stimuli (to include stimulation of the non-classical receptive field as well as the classical receptive field) while recording from V1 neurons at various membrane potentials we will determine the relative contributions of excitatory and inhibitory events to increases in action potential selectivity and sparseness associated with responses to naturalistic stimulation. These studies will reveal fundamental mechanisms of cortical gain control spike timing and neuronal signaling and lead to a better and more thorough understanding of visual cortical network function and dysfunction. The cerebral cortex is the most important structure of the human brain yet is only partially understood. We will examine the basic operating principles of the visual cortex and how it encodes information allowing for proper behavioral function. Our studies will give fundamental information relevant to understanding not only vision but also attention and memory.      ","413750",

Current approaches taken by many e.g. the Cre-driver line creation usually utilize genes relatively specifically expressed in certain cell types. However such ""marker"" genes rarely label a really specific neuronal population. It is highly desirable to further refine the target specificity into a particular region or a specific population of neurons. To achieve this we propose to systematically evaluate a number of combinatorial strategies and develop a series of transgenic tools to drive highly specific gene expression through the intersection of the expression of 2 marker genes. Through mining our genome-wide database Allen Brain Atlas Dr. Zeng and colleagues have identified a large set of gene markers for different cortical cell types. Dr. Nagy has developed a set of gene targeting and allele replacement strategies for expressing multiple genes efficiently. Allen Institute has a high throughput ISH platform and capability of high resolution image acquisition and databasing. By combining the superb technologies developed by both parties we will examine the colocalization of different marker genes by double fluorescent ISH (dFISH) create both driver and reporter/responder mouse lines to test different intersection strategies and use the dFISH again to systematically characterize and database where the controlled gene expression occurs in the entire mouse brain. In this grant we will use the neocortex as a model to establish the technology. Once completed it can be applied easily into other brain regions as well. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studying the extreme complexity of the brain demands ways to tease apart its components. Traditional transgenic tools have been widely used in every area of neuroscience research. Our proposed research will provide two types of powerful tools to the neuroscience community: transgenic mouse lines that can direct genetic manipulation to highly specific neuronal populations and an image database comprehensively documenting where such manipulation occurs. Both of these tools will have major impact on the broad neuroscience community from molecular to systems neuroscience from development to behavior studies from studies of normal brain physiology to disease mechanisms.       ","377537",

This cell wall-less prokaryote moves by gliding motility which we contend facilitates colonization of the conducting airways of the respiratory tract. Gliding motility is poorly understood and no homologs of known motility genes gliding or otherwise are found in M. pneumoniae. In the current project period we identified a diverse set of gliding- associated genes demonstrated conclusively that the terminal organelle alone is the gliding motor defined the requirement and function of several terminal organelle components in gliding and generated direct evidence that gliding is required for colonization of mucosal epithelium. The studies proposed here build upon that foundation to define further the role of gliding in pathogenesis and explore the mechanical basis for gliding encompassing three specific aims. Aim 1 addresses the gliding mechanism focusing on gliding-associated proteins P65 P41 and P24. The terminal organelle detaches from the cell body with the loss of P41 but retains gliding function. Insertions in the P65 gene result in the dragging of surface adhesin P30 from the terminal organelle to the trailing end where it detaches to leave a trail behind the gliding cell. In the absence of P41 P24 foci appear to move along the long axis of the cell. In the next project period we will apply biochemical and cell imaging approaches including electron cryotomography to explore further the roles of P24 P41 P65 and other selected proteins in gliding. In Aim 2 we will analyze in detail certain gliding mutants exhibiting a distinctive lawn-like growth as a result of disruption of the genes for the only annotated M. pneumoniae protein phosphatase and cognate ser/thr protein kinase. We will confirm cause and effect for these mutants and explore the impact of loss of protine kinase or phosphatase function on the phosphorylation of terminal organelle proteins HMW1 and HMW2. We will also examine cell behavior of these mutants in detail by microcinematography to establish how lawn-like growth is achieved. In Aim 3 we will use a differentiated normal human bronchial epithelium model and wild-type and gliding-defective mycoplasmas to explore how gliding motility specifically contributes to resistance of mucociliary defenses in the colonization of conducting airways. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the leading cause of pneumonia in older children and young adults and accounts for 20% of all community-acquired pneumonia. Most infections result in respiratory disease that is chronic and protracted impacting attendance at school and productivity in the workplace and permanent lung damage can result. In addition a growing body of evidence supports a significant contributing role for M. pneumoniae in onset and recurrence of asthma. The studies proposed here will elucidate the mechanism and role of gliding motility in the colonization of the conducting airways.      ","351000",

The project's focus is a remotely powered and controlled artificial electrocyte (electric-organ cell) able to perform high precision neuro-stimulation. The same machine could also be used as a nano-sensor that would be delivered to its target by chemical tags or during surgical intervention. Such sensors may reveal never before seen intimate details of the transmission of neural signals and of their pathological interruption. The nano-machine will be self-assembled using the DNA ""origami"" approach. With this method a platform of the order of 500 nanometers (nm) across will be built with all its onboard components integrated into their designed locations with 2 nm precision. The on-board components include a liposome-based artificial electrocyte. The basic charge transfer unit is an artificial reaction center coupled to a quinoine-based redox loop that functions as a photodriven proton pump incorporated in the liposome wall. It is discharged on command by the opening of proton channels in the wall using a spiropyran-based photochromically active molecule. The power and command is provided through light that is amplified by on-board tuned plasmonic antennas. Thousand-fold amplification of the incident light has been reported for these nanostructures. The development proceeds in a stepping-stone approach where every component is assembled onto the platform and tested individually both in bulk (in solution) and in detail (using Atomic Force Microscopy Scanning Microscopy and Single Molecule Electronics measurements). The key milestones are: (i) Verification of antenna amplification using a fluorescent molecule precisely positioned at the antenna's calculated ""hot spot"". (ii) Chemical verification of proton pump function (iii) Verification of assembly of insulated electrocyte chain. (iv) Verification of discharge function by measuring the voltage developed at the end of a single-chain liposome electrocyte. (v) Final assembly and test. Even if this decade does not see the advent of the in vivo nano-machine the technology developed working towards this goal has many other near-term bio-science applications. The DNA self-assembly process can be applied to the manufacture of nano-instruments on the tips of existing micro-devices. The light-powered artificial electrocyte could become a new tool in micro-surgery and in the study of cell cultures human and bacterial. In fact the in vitro applications of these nano-machines to the study of cell colonies would in itself constitute a novel and powerful tool for the advancement of cellular biology.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infectious and degenerative diseases progress through the breakdown of the body's cellular systems at the microscopic level. Therefore the ultimate way to observe understand and combat disease is to operate at the same level using microscopic machines. Such nanomachines could offer new less intrusive methods to perform deep brain stimulation as well as provide detailed data on the nerve surface damage leading to Multiple Sclerosis.      ","291770",

The power of these methods for interrogation of the pathways regulating growth has recently been demonstrated for yeast but the field is less developed for bacteria partly due to a lack of experimental tools. We propose to develop and exploit quantitative genetic approaches for prokaroytic organisms opening up the power of these approaches initially to two organisms E. coli a gram negative model organism and S. pneumoniae a gram positive pathogen. We will build the methodology we developed in E. coli to systematically introduce gene disruptions two at a time. We will carry out the procedure en masse initially focusing on genes involved in cell envelope function and DNA metabolism so that the effect on bacterial growth of thousands of combinations of pair-wise disruptions can be analyzed and compared. We will apply the analytical tools that had led to important insights into yeast cell biology to our data set and refine them for bacteria. These approaches have proven powerful for discovering the function of uncharacterized genes and the nature of protein pathways and networks within the cell. We will complement quantitative genetic interaction studies with chemical genetic initiatives thus experimentally linking pharmacological targets to the genes involved in their biology. In this way a more complete picture of how bacterial proteins function and how different areas of bacterial cell biology are interconnected will be assembled. Moreover this work in E. coli and S. pneumoniae will confer more power on existing comparative genomic data for hundreds of bacteria. Great emphasis will be placed on dissemination of the results (which will be of wide interest) via searchable database that will link to other relevant websites (e.g. EcoliHub) so that diverse datasets can be integrated as well as providing the community with the experimental tools (strains plasmids libraries computer programs etc.) needed to extend this approach to other organisms.

A significant challenge in the development and testing of new therapies is determining which tumors a drug will target. Initial studies with a novel class of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic pathways show therapeutic responsiveness in some breast cancers. Here we propose to investigate the epigenetic changes that underlie diverse molecular phenotypes of breast cancer whose expression patterns have been previously considered on a global scale. We hope to identify which molecular phenotypes of breast cancer will be targeted by specific epigenetic pathway inhibitors. In this proposal we will activate different epigenetic pathways in normal human mammary epithelial cells using adenoviruses carrying six different histone deacetylase (HDAC) or DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family member genes to define six pathway expression signatures characterized by system-wide patterns of activated and silenced genes. A set of over 1800 breast cancers grouped by molecular phenotype (e.g. basal luminal) will be queried for each of the six epigenetic pathway signatures to discover the specific epigenetic pathways that are deregulated in each phenotype. Next we will determine which drugs best treat different phenotypes of breast cancer. Cell lines representing different molecular phenotypes of breast cancer will be treated with six different HDAC and DNMT inhibitors. The association of drug response to molecular phenotype in vitro will be used to predict tumor response in vivo. To do this we will use fresh human tumors classified by microarray analysis and orthotopically implanted in immunocompromised mice to create a panel of tumor-specific xenograft models that represent the most aggressive molecular phenotypes of breast cancer: basal ERBB2-overexpressing and highly proliferating luminals. We will test the same six HDAC and DNMT inhibitors on the mouse models and measure how well they and a conventional chemotherapeutic agent (doxorubicin) inhibit tumor growth verifying the in vitro predictions in an in vivo model system. We hope that our results will provide preclinical evidence for the initiation of a human trial that employs a more focused approach to the use of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic processes by defining specific phenotypes of breast cancer that a given drug should target rather than testing that drug on all breast cancers. This proposal should demonstrate how tumor biology and genomic signatures can be translated into strategies for personalized cancer treatment.       ","401548",

In the past attempts to re-establish synaptic connectivity following injury have met great difficulties. A new work yielded evidence that mechanical force applied either naturally or artificially at individual nascent synapses initiates and enhances their connectivity. This FORCE (force orchestrated retrograde synaptic enhancement) mechanism is likely based on a property of cells conserved through evolution and thus has the potential to apply widely including regenerative medicine. In this project we seek to establish the basis for novel strategies that make synaptic restoration possible. Genetics bioengineering computational bioinformatics and nanotechnology will be combined to test the hypothesis: mechanical force not only initiates and enhances but also restores neural connectivity. If successful this project will shift the focus in regenerative medicine from moleculo-centric to mechano-centric approaches.

Therefore scanning the genome for genetic associations to a specific disease is hampered by the fact that different individuals with the same disease could have different underlying genetic causes.  When associations are found they are often weak or relate to only one population of individuals sharing a particular genetic history. To alleviate this limitation we need a broader view of the molecular assemblages that specify particular phenotypes and need to develop  better systems for the analysis of complex phenotypes. Disease phenotypes especially for the  most significant diseases like cancer are often the result of a breakdown in a basic cellular or  developmental process. Thus in the long term this project aims to build a systems view of the  molecular mechanisms driving these basic processes and use this information to inform the  analysis of genome wide association studies. To begin this process we will build a systems view  of early embryogenesis in mouse and human and connect them to specific phenotypic outcomes  underlying basic cell and developmental processes. This approach has been very successful in  the model C. elegant where groups of genes required for specific phenotypes were identified  on a genome-wide scale. We will use similar computational and experimental approaches as  well as use a compendium of data from several model systems to build a systems view of early  embryonic development in mouse and human. Specifically we will work on the following three  related aims: 1: Develop a computational framework to predict the global molecular map  underlying early embryonic development in mouse and human. 2: Gather high-content  phenotypic data during early embryogenesis using RNAi of ~400 mouse genes; digitally encode  their complex phenotypic effect and combine with transcriptome data and the computational  map built in Aim 1. 3: Develop an open-access Web-environment to navigate and analyze these  complex data including time-lapse recordings of early embryonic phenotypes so that they can  be used to analyze genome-wide associations' studies. This work will have direct implications  for diagnosis of embryonic viability in a clinical setting and due to the pleiotropic roles of many  genes will in turn provide insights into complex phenotypes associated with a variety of  developmental and metabolic disorders as well as other disease processes like cancer which  involves deregulation of cell proliferation vs. differentiation.      ","355294",

We also demonstrate that a 20-  kilobase insertion/deletion polymorphism upstream of IRGM is associated with altered  IRGM expression and is tightly linked to CD associated SNPs. These findings provide  the first example of a structural variant influencing disease risk via expression of a  nearby gene. We will integrate all available GWAS data discover specifically causal  coding and regulatory variants via high throughput sequencing define the impact of  these variants on gene expression (locally and globally) and assemble the set of  variants into a systems level model involving potential genetic interactions on their  influence on risk or gene expression. Given the involvement of two genes central to the  autophagy response we propose to apply systems approaches synthetic biology and  unique genetic tools to dissect mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CD. This  proposal probes the function or consequences of and pathways that interact with  human mutations that have been validated as playing a causal role in Crohn's disease.    The broad goals of this proposal will pursued through studies of three specific aims:  Aim 1: To define specific variants associated with Crohn's disease suitable for functional analysis.  Aim 2: To identify small molecules that cause different cellular effects in epithelial cells and lymphoblastoid cells bearing mutations that are implicated in Crohn's disease.  Aim 3: To delineate proteins required for ATG16L1 and IRGM autophagy response to bacteria using RNAi loss of function analysis      ","373469",

Project Summary/Abstract Recoding describes the local reprogramming of mRNA translation to discard standard translational rules and decode non-canonically. The products of this stimulated process proteins incorporating shifts in reading frame bypassed nucleotide segments and/or unexpected amino acids have been observed in all 3 domains and are known to contribute importantly to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Our hypothesis is that recoded and miscoded proteins are more important than previously anticipated but that they are consistently overlooked by high-throughput proteomic methods that regard the proteome as a mirror of the genome. We believe that an altered proteomic workflow can reveal proteins recoded and miscoded in vivo and that these methods can provide amino acid sequences for some of the recoded products. If successful these efforts can potentially impact research in protein translation microbiology and proteomics. They can impact the development of therapies for genetic diseases and can suggest explanations for the unusual activity differences observed for some gene products differing only by a synonymous polymorphism. They may also suggest a function for pseudo-messenger RNA. B.

However present-day designs are far from ideal and  significant complications such as hemolysis plateletdestruction and thromboembolism often arise after  their implantation requiring aggressive life long anticoagulation therapy which in turn carries serious  side effects. Improving current PHV designs however needs highly accurate flow quantification - a  task not achievable until recently due to the complex and intricate geometries of PHVs combined with  the lack of an appropriate computational methodology to tackle the complexities of PHV flows. Novel  fluid-structure interaction CFD tools have been successfully developed and validated in the current  grant. Along with numerous experimental studies this numerical tool has yielded the first ever in depth  understanding of the complex physics of PHV flows under physiological conditions and at hemodynamically relevant scales. The proposed competing renewal takes the next step towards  achieving the development of a computational framework for improving valve prosthesis designs on a  patient-specific basis. Current Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology makes it possible to  obtain full 3D moving geometries at resolution sufficiently high to prescribe aorta and ventricular wall  motions as boundary conditions for the numerical model. By coupling high resolution CFD techniques  with the latest advancements in MRI technology a powerful and clinically useful hemodynamic/fluid  dynamic analysis tool could be developed for the benefit of PHV recipients.    The overall hypothesis driving this competing renewal is: High resolution imaging-based Computational  Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling can be used to develop viable patient-specific hemodynamic tools  where cardiac devices (not only limited to heart valve prostheses) may be evaluated prior to patient  treatment. This hypothesis will be addressed in the following four aims:    Aim 1: Development of CFD tools for left ventricle/aorta configuration    Aim 2: In vitro experiments for validation in a phantom left ventricle/aorta configuration with moving  boundaries    Aim 3: Develop image processing methods for reconstruction of anatomically accurate moving ventricle  and aorta geometries    Aim 4: Preliminary application of the computational tools for patient simulation and analysis Completion  of this project will lead to a significant advancement in the field of heart valve flow analysis and the  development of fluid mechanically improved cardiac devices.

Currently there are no interventions that are effective in reducing or permanently eliminating tinnitus a disorder that significantly degrades the quality of life for an estimated 7 million people. The goal of the proposed research is to identify the brain areas and pathological processes responsible for the development and persistence of chronic tinnitus using an animal model. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that chronic tinnitus is associated with increased activity in the auditory brainstem and the cerebellum. Areas with significantly altered activity were the cochlear nucleus (CN) the inferior colliculus (IC) and the paraflocculus (PF) of the cerebellum. Particularly intriguing was that the enhanced activity in the PF was restricted to subjects with tinnitus whereas enhanced activity in the CN and IC was also evident in normal subjects listening to an external source of a tinnitus-like sound. A working hypothesis for these observations is that peripheral auditory insults alter functional activity in focal brain areas and produce enhanced spontaneous activity that is perceived as tinnitus. Enhanced activity may emerge because ?-amino butyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition is downregulated and this process may be driven by glutamate-mediated neuroplasticity. The proposed experiments will test these hypotheses by combining a functional imaging technique manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) with volume-localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Psychophysical evidence of tinnitus will be established in rats using a method shown to be effective in discriminating animals with tinnitus from animals without tinnitus. The brains of rats with and without tinnitus will be compared using MEMRI. MEMRI will identify brain areas that have enhanced spontaneous activity using high resolution imaging techniques. In the same animals the identified areas will be examined using H-MRS. Spectra will be determined for the 1 inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic acid (Glu). The spectra will be used to determine tissue concentrations enabling inferential conclusions regarding the up- and down- regulation of these transmitters. Comparison of transmitter function in each area of interest (AOI) will be used to confirm or modify the working hypotheses about the pathological processes at work. For example elevated Glu and decreased GABA in an AOI would support the working hypothesis regarding pathological plasticity in the AOI. Since the preceding data are associational follow-up ablation experiments will be used to determine the causal connection between an AOI and tinnitus. In these experiments a specific AOI will be ablated either before or after tinnitus induction. Ablations before induction will enable conclusions to be drawn about tinnitus trigger zones while ablations after induction will enable conclusions to be drawn about tinnitus generator sites. AOI ablation should decrease tinnitus if dysfunction in that area is necessary for tinnitus. Based on existing data the dorsal cochlear nucleus and the PF will be targeted in initial ablation experiments.   Relevance: Tinnitus is the perception of a sound when there is no external sound. Fifteen million adults in the U.S. describe their tinnitus as bothersome and seven million have severe disabling tinnitus that degrades their quality of life and interferes with daily activities. Currently there are no interventions that are either generally effective or permanently eliminate tinnitus. The goal of the proposed research is to understand processes in the brain responsible for the development and persistence of chronic tinnitus using an animal model and biomedical imaging technology. The benefit of the proposed studies is that they will identify brain areas and pathological processes that may then be targeted for therapeutic intervention.        ","365670",

In this proposal we plan to develop new functionalization chemistry for single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) to achieve tumor specific delivery of chemotherapeutics. We also plan to utilize the intrinsic optical properties (Raman & photoluminescence) of nanotubes for detection and imaging for monitoring and understanding the biodistribution and treatment efficacy of SWNT-drug complexes. We hope to fully demonstrate the novelty of using carbon nanotubes for biomedical applications owing to the unique structural chemical and physical properties of SWNTs including (1) one-dimensional structure (diameter ~1nm tunable length) and high surface area ~1000m2/g (2) non-toxic chemical composition: carbon (3) strong Raman spectroscopic lines for raman tags and (4) band-gap fluorescence or photoluminescence properties in the near IR (NIR) for fluorescence imaging and detection. These distinguish SWNTs from various other nanomaterials and make them ideally suited for biological applications. We have promising preliminary results showing that SWNTs can be functionalized to render biocompatibility in vivo in mice. SWNTs are non-toxic when administered intravenously at high doses. Nanotubes retained in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and are gradually excreted out of the body via the biliary and renal pathways. Our preliminary data also indicate that paclitaxel- SWNT conjugate is superior to the Cremophor ELP solubilized paclitaxel (PTX) for cancer therapy. In this R01 proposal we will extend such efforts and perform systematic studies to identify an optimal nanotube functionalization scheme using branched hydrophilic molecules. We will then attach paclitaxel via cleavable ester bonds to the functionalized nanotubes for tumor treatment with low side toxicity effects to normal organs. We will investigate in vivo blood circulation biodistribution tumor uptake and distribution within tumor for functionalized SWNTs and SWNT-drug conjugates for understanding the treatment results and identifying the best SWNT-PTX conjugate with the optimal tumor treatment efficacy and lowest side effect toxicity. We will investigate the tumor treatment efficacy of SWNT-PTX by passive targeting and compare with Cremophor ELP and Abraxane in mice xenograft tumor models. We will also carry out targeted drug delivery for highly efficient tumor killing using SWNT-PTX conjugates co-functionalized with RGD peptide for specific integrin recognition and binding to tumors. Finally we will combine heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitions and SWNT-PTX treatment to investigate if Hsp90 inhibitor affords enhancement of paclitaxel tumor treatment efficacy.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use a novel one-dimensional molecule single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) for cancer drug delivery and for cancer imaging using their intrinsic optical properties. These nano-technological advances will lead to new formulations for chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel to afford higher cancer treatment efficacy and lower toxic side effects than currently FDA approved Taxol and Abraxane providing doctors with better drugs to battle cancer using nanotechnology.      ","328870",

Many isolates are multi-drug resistant and some isolates are resistant to all currently extant anti-infective agents. There are currently no new antibiotics in clinical development (in man) with novel mechanisms of action against Pseudomonas. Given the cycle time associated with new drug development it is likely that no antibiotics with new mechanisms of action for this pathogen will arise for 5 - 7 years. Thus we must generate new knowledge about how best to suppress antibiotic resistance for this pathogen. This will help preserve our current drugs while we await new agents. Also when agents with new mechanisms of action become available they can be developed in an optimal fashion for resistance suppression both as monotherapy and in combination. In this application (Specific Aim #1) we hypothesize that we can identify optimal doses and schedules of administration for monotherapy for resistance suppression by studying this pathogen in our Hollow Fiber Infection Model (HFIM) and fitting a large mathematical model to the HFIM data to identify these doses and schedules. We further hypothesize that different resistance mechanisms will alter optimal doses and schedules. We propose to study isogenic mutants of the wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO-1 isolate each containing a defined resistance mechanism. These findings will be bridged to man through use of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). In Specific Aim #2 we propose to examine drugs in combination chemotherapy. We have developed a completely novel mathematical model that allows description of the impact of two drug combination chemotherapy on isolates of P. aeruginosa. This model is a mixture model and allows the fitting of the model to the concentration-time course of both agents as well as to fit the model to the disparate changes over time wrought by the combination of agents on the susceptible and less-susceptible populations of organisms present. Robust identification of the parameters of this system will allow calculation of optimal combination regimens for resistance suppression. Such regimens will be bridged to man through the use of MCS as above. The HFIM is an in vitro system. In Specific Aim #3 we will also validate these optimal and non-optimal regimens in a neutropenic mouse pneumonia model employing the same isolates studied in vitro in Aims #1 and #2. In examining this we will use ""humanized"" dosing for the regimens so that differences between mouse and human pharmacokinetics will not drive an improper inference. This will be done for both mono- and combination therapy. Prospective validation experiments will be designed and carried out. Results will be compared with the in vitro findings and also bridged to man. In so doing robust principles will be defined for drug regimens that will suppress amplification of resistant mutant populations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen of major importance in the Intensive Care Unit and is often resistant to many or even all of the drugs in our therapeutic armamentarium. As no agents with a unique mechanism of action active against Pseudomonas are expected for at least 7 years it is imperative to learn how to use our currently available agents in a way that suppresses emergence of resistance and keeps these agents active for our patients. We plan to do this by 1) understanding the optimal way to dose Pseudomonas-active drugs in our hollow fiber infection model (HFIM) to suppress resistance and delineate the impact of different resistance mechanisms on this process 2) understand how to administer these drugs in combination in the HFIM to optimally suppress resistance emergence 3) validate the in vitro findings from the HFIM in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.        ","787916",

For major genes known to affect risk an important task is to determine the risks conferred by individual variants. Geneticists consider variants to confer risk if they have been shown to segregate with disease in families but increasingly the evidence will accrue from population-based association studies where empirical evidence is obtained on the basis of case and control frequencies for all observed variants many of which will necessarily occur very infrequently perhaps only once in the study. Furthermore many of these variants will not have been observed in previous cancer-prone families. Hierarchical modeling offers a natural strategy to leverage the collective evidence from these rare variants with sparse data. This can be accomplished when the variants can be effectively grouped on the basis of higher- level covariates that characterize the functional properties of the variants that are relevant to risk prediction. In this application we propose to study in detail the properties of available hierarchical modeling techniques for this purpose and suitable modifications of these techniques with a view to establishing valid analytic strategies for obtaining relative risk estimates for rare variants. We will use simulations to evaluate the small sample properties of pseudo-likelihood estimation of the relative risks of rare variants from a hierarchical model. The simulations will address bias and cover- age probabilities of the individual estimators their relative efficiency compared to ordinary logistic regression the influence of the predictiveness of the higher-level covariates the impact of model misspecification the influence of sample size the impact of missing data on higher-level covariates and the use of explained variation as a measure of extent to which the higher-level covariates explain the risk variation. We will also examine the asymptotic properties of pseudo-likelihood estimation under various assumptions: a correctly specified hierarchical model; an incorrectly specified hierarchical model; and a setting in which the number of variants is allowed to increase indefinitely but data on the individual variants remains sparse. These investigations address distinct questions of practical importance in the design and analysis of association (case-control) studies of major cancer genes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many major genes have been identified that strongly in0uence the risk of cancer. However there are typically many different mutations in the gene each of which may or may not confer increased risk. It is critical to identify which genetic mutations are harmful and which ones are harmless so that individuals who learn from genetic testing that they have a mutation can be appropriately counseled. This is a challenging task since new mutations are continually being identified and there is typically relatively little evidence available about each individual mutation. In this proposal we plan to examine new statistical techniques that have the potential to identify the mutations that are harmful with much greater accuracy. The research will involve hierarchical statistical modeling a technique that aggregates the evidence about lots of rare mutations to increase the ability to predict the effects of each mutation individually.      ","314943",

Our previous perspective of a gene and the general concept for how a cell codes for proteins from DNA is still generally true for Bacteria and Archaea. However in Eukaryotes this perspective is being replaced with the notion that the complexity of an organism scales with the amount of RNA not Protein that is coded for in its genome. The functional properties of these RNA molecules are directly associated with their higher-order structure. Thus the prediction and identification of this structure from sequence will provide the foundation to understand the details of their function. Since the structural and functional properties of some recently discovered RNAs such as different micro RNAs are involved in the regulation of normal and aberrant cellular processes studies that focus on RNA are expected to help determine the molecular biology for different diseases and provide the basis for new drug therapies. Comparative analysis of RNA sequences and structures have been very successful in the elucidation of the entire structure of an RNA molecule and in the identification and characterization of the basic building blocks of RNA - structural motifs and structural elements. One of the PIs of this proposal has established the ""Comparative RNA Web (CRW)"" site that disseminates collections and analysis of different types of comparative information for a few select RNA molecules. However based on the significant increase in the number of sequences for the initial set of RNAs studied in this project and now the significant increase in the number of RNAs that are being identified we are developing a novel computational foundation intended to establish repeatable protocols for the comparative analysis of RNA sequences and structures. The current CRW Site will become a fully dynamic web service for the general scientific community to perform comparative analysis on their own RNAs benefiting from the collection of RNA sequence and structure information and the computational infrastructure at the CRW Site. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANDE:  Based on the functional importance of RNA and its higher-order structure we are developing a novel computational foundation for the comparative analysis of RNA. This resource will benefit experimental laboratories that are studying RNAs that are associated with many different normal and aberrant processes in the cell and could directly influence the development of new drug therapies.       ","272000",

The means by which stress contributes to these AD hallmarks remain to be elucidated. We have found that acute exposure to an emotional stressor (physical restraint) elicits robust increases in tau phosphorylation (tau-P) in mouse hippocampus a pivotal structure in learning and memory. We fail to implicate stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion in this respect but find the response is abolished by disruption of signaling via the type 1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1) and exaggerated in CRFR2-deficient mice. Moreover while acute restraint-induced increments in hippocampal tau-P were short-lived repeated daily stress sessions (14 days) led to cumulative increases in tau-P and its sequestration in insoluble pre-pathogenic form. Five aims employing a range of biochemical histochemical/neuroanatomical and behavioral assays are proposed to further explore the role of stress and the CRF signaling system in mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. First we will determine whether acute restraint-induced tau-P generalizes to other brain regions afflicted in AD other stressors that differ in potency and kind and probe the biochemical mechanisms underlying the response. Second to define the underlying circuitry we will characterize sites of stress-induced tau-P (and cellular activation) using transgenic mice that report CRFR expression use combined retrograde tracing and histochemical methods to identify sources of CRF ligand-containing inputs to hippocampus and then test experimentally the involvement of implicated neural pathways. Third we will characterize the effects of repeated exposure to emotional stress on tau-P and A production and explore their mechanisms and CRFR-dependence. Immunoelectron microscopy will be used to pursue preliminary evidence that repeated stress results in the formation of pre-pathogenic tau aggregates. Fourth we will assess the ability of stress exposure over a significant portion of lifespan to modulate histochemical biochemical and behavioral indices of tau and A pathogenesis in a murine model of AD as well as in normal aging and determine the CRFR-dependence of observed effects. Finally we will take advantage of a unique repository of brain material from human AD patients thoroughly characterized antemortem on indices of stress sensitivity and cognitive impairment to determine how the expression of CRF signaling molecules is altered in AD and the extent to which such alterations may correlate with behavioral measures. The results are expected to clarify (1) the capacity of emotional stress exposure to promulgate AD- related tau and A pathogenesis (2) the neural circuitry and biochemical mechanisms underlying such effects and (3) the extent to which they are mediated/modulated by signaling through CRFRs which may well prove to warrant consideration as targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting memory and other higher brain functions which currently afflicts roughly five million Americans. This project builds on our recent finding that a key biochemical process involved in Alzheimer's Disease can be stimulated by single or repeated exposures to stresses of the kind encountered in everyday life and that blocking a particular neurotransmitter system in the brain can eliminate this potentially deleterious effect of stress. In deepening understanding of the brain circuits and mechanisms underlying these effects the proposed experiments will evaluate a legitimate candidate target for the development of drugs that may slow or prevent the progression of Alzheimer's Disease.      ","391139",

This association persists despite changes in national substance use rates over time indicating its stability and viability as a target for prevention. At the same time parent monitoring of youth behavior tends to decrease during the adolescent years creating a source of risk for the early onset of substance use. Thus programs that foster parenting behaviors and family relationships that are protective in helping youth to avoid substance abuse are an important area of continuing research. To date most of the research has been conducted on universal prevention programs based in schools. Some selective prevention programs with high risk groups have also been conducted in schools. Only rarely do these universal or selective programs involve parents. The Family Check-Up (FCU) is an exception to this trend as it is a selective intervention program that focuses on parents. A unique strength of the FCU is that feedback is individualized and tailored to specific parenting skills as they typically pertain to an identified adolescent in the family. Our group has found that the Family Check-Up had better effects on reducing alcohol use in teens presenting to an Emergency Department as alcohol-positive at 6 month follow-up than an individual motivational intervention. In this application which is submitted in response to PA-07-406 ""Screening and Brief Interventions in Underage and Young Adult Alcohol Populations"" we propose to evaluate the efficacy of the FCU when applied to both an adolescent Identified Patient (IP) and a sibling close in age. Our rationale for including a sibling close in age derives from a strong empirical base which has shown that: 1) sibling resemblance for alcohol use is high and environmental factors shared by siblings account for substantial portions of variance in adolescent alcohol use; and 2) specific interactional dynamics of the sibling relationship (collusion) are related to teen alcohol use. In order to determine whether other types of family-based interventions might be just as helpful as the FCU efficacy of the sibling-enhanced FCU will be compared to a parenting psychoeducational program Family Matters (FM). The major goal of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a sibling-enhanced FCU in reducing alcohol and other drug use in an adolescent IP presenting with an alcohol-related event and a sibling close in age. Changes in parental monitoring and other adolescent health risk behaviors will also be measured over a 1-year period.      ","635168",

This proposal brings together a new photodetector technology position-sensitive solid state photomultipliers (SSPMs) with highly segmented scintillator arrays to create a depth-encoding detector that will permit the design of a much higher sensitivity small-animal PET scanner whilst maintaining spatial resolution and without increasing the complexity of the system in terms of number of channels of electronics. SSPMs combine the advantages of photomultiplier tubes (high gain and fast timing) with the advantages of avalanche photodiodes (thin cross-section higher quantum efficiency magnetic field tolerance) and thus offer an attractive opportunity for PET imaging. The two technological innovations in this proposal are the creation of large-area position-sensitive SSPMs allowing multiplexed readout of many SSPMs with a small number of electronic channels and the fact that the SSPMs are produced by a standard CMOS process that is easily scaleable and also allows incorporation of other electronic components right on the detector chip. By using position-sensitive SSPMs on either end of finely segmented scintillator arrays depth-encoding detector modules can be designed that simultaneously offer very high spatial resolution and very high efficiency. This leads to PET scanner designs for small-animal imaging that have much higher sensitivity without increasing the number of detector modules compared with current state-of-the-art systems. The significance of this proposal is that it offers a cost-effective pathway to much higher sensitivity PET imaging without degrading spatial resolution. This sensitivity improvement can be used to increase signal-to-noise increase temporal resolution or decrease administered dose. This will be critical in many cancer applications for example allowing improved imaging and quantification of less abundant molecular targets detection of smaller number of cells in cellular therapies and detection of smaller changes in radiotracer accumulation in response to interventions.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to develop a highly sensitive positron emission tomography (PET) scanner for preclinical studies of new therapeutic and diagnostic cancer agents in mouse models of human cancer. This translational technology platform will help better identify appropriate new therapeutic and diagnostic agents to move into human clinical trials and may reduce the time and cost of bringing these new agents to the clinic.      ","270000",

For all organisms a significant remaining impediment to this goal is the limited number of transcription factors (TFs) with well-characterized DNA-binding specificities. We have developed a bacterial one-hybrid system that provides a rapid method to characterize the DNA-binding specificities of TFs. Using this technology we have determined the specificity of 15% (108/~750) of all of the predicted sequence-specific transcription factors in Drosophila melanogaster. This catalog of specificities includes proteins representing 12 different types of DNA-binding domains and all 84 independent homeodomain family members. To complement this dataset we have developed computational tools that map the genomic distribution of TF binding site frequencies and use this information to identify putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) for any combination of TFs in our dataset. A web-based interface allows users to perform genome-wide searches for CRMs or to display binding site frequencies for TFs or combinations of TFs as tracks within the popular Gbrowse interface.    We now propose to characterize the DNA-binding specificity of all remaining D. melanogaster TFs including all monomeric and homo-oligomeric TFs as well as all functional heterodimeric combinations from the basic leucine zipper and basic helix-loop-helix families. We will also refine our computational tools to improve their ability to distinguish CRMs within the genome and we will integrate other data sources (e.g. ChIP-chip datasets) to enhance the ability to predict CRMs. This effort will culminate in the development of web-accessible database and search tools that will allow the scientific community to computationally identify putative CRMs that are regulated by any combination of factors of interest. An outgrowth of our analysis will be genome-wide annotations of CRMs for subsets of factors that function in known transcriptional regulatory networks.    To date a complete description of TF specificities has not been obtained in any organism. Combined with improved computational tools and the extensive and growing body of experimental studies on D. melanogaster transcription a catalog of TF specificities will allow the systematic annotation of CRMs throughout its genome. Once developed these databases and tools should be directly applicable to the annotation of CRMs in other organisms including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the genome project has extensively mapped which DNA sequences in humans and other organisms encode genes mapping the regulatory regions that turn genes on and off has proven to be much more difficult. We will use newly developed experimental and computational tools to systematically map these control elements in an entire genome. This new genome ""map"" will help researchers understand how these elements function in normal cells and how mutations in these elements can lead to disease.      ","643280",

Our initial analysis has led to four sets of results: 1) Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) undergo many structural and molecular alterations as they age. 2) Preterminal portions of motor axons exhibit regions of abnormal thinning distension and sprouting. 3) Atrophy and synaptic changes in aged muscles are correlated on a fiber-by-fiber basis. 4) Although NMJs in most muscles are ravaged by age those in a few are spared. Here we propose studies designed to explore the relationships among these changes identify molecular defects that underlie them and test one way to reverse them. First we will follow up preliminary observation of a dramatic and specific decline in levels of three known synaptic organizing molecules at aging NMJs -laminins 4 and 2 and agrin. We will correlate changes in the levels and distribution of these proteins with structural alterations and ask whether targeted null or conditional mutants with decreased levels of these proteins show premature synaptic aging. Second we will seek transport defects that underlie axonal dystrophy by correlative light and electron microscopy along with use of new transgenic mice in which mitochondria and synaptic vesicles are labeled. Third we will determine the relationship between the synaptic abnormalities and sarcopenia the clinically significant age-related decline in muscle mass and strength. Using transgenic mice in which single motor axons and muscle fibers of specific types are selectively labeled we will assess myogenic and neurogenic determinants of sarcopenia. Fourth we will follow up our observation that extraocular muscles are spared from age-related neuromuscular decline. This result is intriguing because extraoculars are also spared in the invariably fatal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggesting parallel mechanisms underlying age-related and neurodegenerative defects. Finally we will use transgenic rescue techniques to ask whether reintroduction of laminins or agrin attenuates age- related synaptic disorganization. Together these studies will provide insights into age- related neural defects that may not only provide ways to ameliorate sarcopenia but also be generally applicable to the nervous system PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The nervous system undergoes disturbing changes with age.

Although much has been learned from animal studies in the last 50 years relatively little is known about the factors influencing visual development in humans. The current proposal investigates whether factors related to visual experience (""nurture"") vs. preprogrammed biological maturation (""nature"") or both are important in shaping visual development. To this end we propose visual psychophysical studies with four different subject populations that tease apart these factors. (A) Fullterm Infants and (B) Healthy Preterm Infants. If early visual experience is the dominant force in visual development preterm infants should show the same developmental trajectories as fullterm infants when plotted in terms of postnatal age (i.e. age since birth). By contrast if biological maturation is more influential preterm infants should match fullterm babies when plotted in postconceptional age (i.e. age since conception). (C) Monozygotic vs. Dizygotic Twins. While both twin types share the same environment and parents they differ in the degree of shared genetic makeup. We apply a biometrical twin model that can identify the proportion of ""phenotypic"" variance in visual performance that can be accounted for by shared environment versus genes. (D) Infants and Children with Early Abnormal Visual Input. Comparisons made between this group (cataract strabismus and anisometropia) and healthy controls will address the vulnerability of various aspects of visual processing to abnormal visual experience early in development. Three aims address different levels of visual processing: 1) Subcortical Pathway Processing: We ask if the three main retinogeniculate pathways Magnocellular (M) Parvocellular (P) and Koniocellular (K) are equally or differentially affected by visual experience by obtaining contrast sensitivities for luminance red/green and blue/yellow stimuli thought to be mediated by these pathways respectively. 2) Subcortical Input to Cortical Motion Processing: We will obtain an estimate of the extent of P vs. M subcortical pathway input to motion processing using a ""Motion/Detection"" threshold ratio paradigm that measures the relative effects of chromatic (P pathway) vs. luminance (M pathway) contrast on motion processing. Previous results from our laboratory suggest that the relative P vs. M input to motion decreases with age and here we will ask whether this re-weighting process is influenced more by visual experience or biological maturation. 3) Cortical Motion Processing: We will assess global motion processing which is believed to be a higher-level cortical function. Unlike many previous studies our global motion stimuli will be scaled to detectability for each subject such that differences observed across ages/subject groups can be more definitively interpreted. The results of these projects which will reveal what aspects of visual development are more vs. less amenable to effects of visual experience may have important implications for treating children with congenital eye disorders.

There are emerging data for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that show higher doses (> 70 Gy) delivered with conformal radiation therapy (CRT) may provide better local control than lower doses (< 70 Gy). The radiation beam size is routinely increased beyond the projected tumor size to account for breathing motion and patient set-up uncertainty. A consequence of this is an increased normal lung irradiated volume which is the main limiting factor to dose escalation. Reducing the irradiated volume will require reductions in the planning and delivery geometric uncertainties. While there have been many individual solutions for simulation techniques and delivery technology there is not yet a solution that integrates high temporal measurements of the tumor position with low temporal but high spatial resolution measurements of tumors and normal structures that can be applicable to the majority of locally advanced lung cancer patients. We propose the integration of real-time tumor tracking with cross-sectional imaging into a radiation therapy treatment planning system that can measure the effects of geometric uncertainty with high precision.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States. This study proposes a method of targeting lung cancer with radiation more precisely. If this can be done one can increase radiation dose to the tumor resulting in improved control of the tumor.      ","292013",

The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the genes containing mutations that result in PBS/IC and determine how the different encoded proteins of these genes interact with one another in a common biological pathway. Ultimately understanding how mutations in up to five different genes yield the symptoms of PBS/IC should lead to improved diagnosis and possible therapies. We plan to attain our goals via the following specific aims: 1) Accurately characterize PBS/IC patients and their family members and enroll them in our genetic studies. Carefully evaluated cohorts of patients and their families are essential to the discovery of the genetic variation underlying PBS/IC. 2) Map the locations of PBS/IC genes by linkage analysis in families in which PBS/IC is segregating. We have already recruited several families with autosomal dominant inheritance of PBS/IC and identified linkage peaks in the most informative pedigrees. 3) Identify within linked regions of the genome the first genes that control inherited risk of PBS/IC and correlate the types of mutations with clinical symptoms. 4) Determine how proteins encoded by these PBS/IC genes interact with one another.

Identifying all the functional components of genomes has become an important goal of the NIH (e.g. via the ENCODE and modENCODE initiatives). A significant fraction of this DNA is believed to be involved in regulating gene expression a fundamental process that plays key roles in both normal development and in disease. A basic unit for gene regulation is the cis-regulatory module (CRM; often referred to as an ""enhancer"") but identification of these modules on a genomic scale has proven difficult. For the most part computational methods for CRM discovery have been effective only in those situations where there is already an extensive body of knowledge about the transcription factors that bind to the CRMs and the sequences (motifs) to which they bind. In this proposal we develop novel computational tools for CRM discovery. In particular we depart from current approaches to CRM discovery by developing algorithms that do not rely on prior knowledge of transcription factor binding motifs. By doing so we are able to identify CRMs even in less well-studied biological contexts where significant prior knowledge is minimal or lacking. We then expand upon this approach by additionally developing methods that utilize partial prior knowledge of CRMs known to be involved in a particular biological process. We will combine our new methods with promising existing approaches to generate a computational pipeline that uses complementary strategies for sensitive and specific CRM discovery and conduct extensive prediction of CRMs that function in many tissues and cell types. We will take advantage of the powerful genomic and experimental resources available for the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to subject all of our methods to validation both in silico and in vivo using a large body of existing CRM data that we have compiled and extensive empirical testing in transgenic animals respectively. The methods we develop here will be instrumental in helping to identify an important class of genomic functional element the cis-regulatory module in any metazoan genome.    cis-Regulatory modules (CRMs) are key mediators of normal phenotypic variation drivers of evolutionary change and causes of birth defects as well as chronic and acute disease. Identifying CRMs genome-wide is an important first step on the way to comprehending both normal and pathological aspects of gene regulation and gene function with broad implications for understanding disease predicting disease risk and preventing and curing disease.       ","351875",

The data generated from such analyses have begun to provide valuable insight to the mechanisms of gene regulation disease pathogenesis embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and development. However application of the technology to most transcription factors is hindered by the lack of ChIP-grade antibodies. To overcome this limitation we have developed a method whereby recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is used to introduce epitope tag-encoding DNA into endogenous loci by homologous recombination-mediated ""knock-in"". As proof of principle we used this strategy to knock-in sequence encoding a triple FLAG epitope (3xFLAG) into the STAT3 and CHD7 loci in colorectal cancer cells. Using ChIP-chip analyses we show that the FLAG tag facilitates genome wide identification of STAT3 and CHD7 binding sites with a commercially available anti-FLAG antibody. In this 3-year R01 application we propose 3 aims. In Aim 1 we will test the general applicability of the targeting approach to cell lines derived from different lineages. In Aim 2 we will assess the fidelity of the 3xFLAG tagged transcription factors for genome wide ChIP analyses. In Aim 3 we will develop methods for high-throughput tagging of a large number of transcription factors. The achievement of these aims should facilitate large-scale ChIP analysis of multiple transcription factors. Such studies will profoundly impact our knowledge of transcriptional networks and the biological processes they control.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Regulation of transcription is a highly coordinated process. Mutations in genes which lead to aberrant regulation of transcription can cause a host of human diseases including developmental disorders neurodegenerative conditions cardiovascular disease and cancer.

In turn this should hasten our understanding of transcriptional regulation and the underlying mechanisms of human disease.       ","392500",

This project is based on our preliminary data showing that CDK5 inhibition in pancreatic cancer cell lines reduced their migration and invasion in vitro and their tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In addition we have found that inhibition of CDK5 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibits signal transduction pathways that are activated by ras. This suggests that CDK5 inhibition may antagonize the ras pathway in pancreatic cancer. Since ras mutation or dysregulation is present in the vast majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas this is a possibility of considerable potential therapeutic significance. A genetically engineered animal model for the role of CDK5 in pancreatic tumorigenesis and metastasis will be developed based on pancreas specific ablation of the Cdk5 gene in the well characterized Pdx1-cre K-ras?G12D p53?R172H model of pancreatic cancer (Hingorani et al 2005). The effect of CDK5 inhibition on downstream ras-mediated signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer cells including RalA RalB MEK/ERK PI3-K and Hedgehog will be examined. The potential that CDK5 affects oncogenic signal transduction through a linear pathway from RalA through effectors src and STAT3 will be explored. The potential that blocking these CDK5-mediated pathways may induce sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents will be examined. The ability of CDK5 to induce or augment aspects of neoplastic transformation in pancreatic epithelial cells will be investigated. A selective CDK5 inhibitor will be evaluated for its potential therapeutic efficacy in an in vivo preclinical platform of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The effect of combination therapy using this CDK5 inhibitor with standard gemcitabine or other chemotherapeutic agents will be explored.

The esterase CocE is the most efficient native enzyme for metabolizing naturally occurring (-)-cocaine yet identified. Through catalysis of (-)-cocaine hydrolysis CocE can both prevent and reverse extreme (-)- cocaine toxicity in rodent models and it has the potential to be developed into a chemically useful antagonist of the toxic and behavioral effects of (-)-cocaine. In order to optimize the efficacy of this potential anti-cocaine medication and minimize its possible side effects (particularly immunogenicity) we propose to improve the catalytic efficiency of CocE against (-)- cocaine. The higher the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against (-)-cocaine the lower the dose required to achieve therapeutic effectiveness and the decrease in dose can reduce the overall immunological response. Hence we will focus on the rational design discovery and preclinical testing of CocE mutants with an improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine. The rational design of high-activity mutants of CocE against (-)-cocaine requires a detailed understanding of the mechanism for CocE-catalyzed hydrolysis of cocaine. This mechanism can be understood by performing computational studies using the state-of-the-art computational techniques of molecular modeling simulation and calculation. The specific aims include: (1) Elucidation of the detailed mechanism and reaction coordinate and the corresponding free energy profiles for CocE-catalyzed hydrolysis of cocaine by performing quantum mechanical (QM) calculations hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations etc. (2) Design discovery and testing of CocE mutants with an improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine by using a recently developed novel computational design approach based on the transition state modeling and simulation to computationally evaluate a large number of hypothetical CocE mutants followed by wet experimental tests including site-directed mutagenesis protein expression and purification and in vitro and in vivo activity tests. The long-term objective of this investigation will be to eventually develop an efficient anti-cocaine medication using a high-activity mutant of CocE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Enhancing cocaine metabolism by administration of cocaine esterase (CocE) has been recognized as a promising treatment strategy for cocaine overdose and addiction. The high-activity mutants of CocE to be designed and discovered in this project will eventually lead to an efficient anti-cocaine medication.      ","498945",

One chemical in particular bisphenol A (BPA) has been the focus of considerable attention and controversy. . BPA is one of the highest volume chemicals in production and humans are exposed to low levels on a daily basis. Recent studies in the mouse indicate that exposure to low levels of BPA during three distinct developmental stages in utero can adversely affect the genetic quality of the egg. Thus these findings and those from a host of other rodent studies raise grave concerns about human fetal exposures. Directly assessing the effects of this chemical in humans however is neither ethically nor experimentally feasible. The proposed studies represent the first attempt to use a more relevant animal model the rhesus monkey to answer questions about the pharmacokinetics of BPA and to directly assess its effects on the early events of oogenesis in the fetal ovary. The oral dose of BPA used in these studies will be carefully monitored so that the resulting blood levels will be within the range currently found in humans. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that BPA clearance rates differ in pregnant and non-pregnant female monkeys and that BPA levels accumulate in fetal tissues. Aim 2 will test the effect of BPA exposure on the earliest events of oogenesis in the fetal ovary. The BPA dose will be carefully timed during the pregnancy to coincide with the time of meiotic entry of the fetal oocytes to determine if BPA disrupts the processes of synapsis and recombination between homologous chromosomes. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that perinatal BPA exposure disrupts follicle formation in the female rhesus monkey. Although BPA exposure has been suggested to induce a variety of effects in experimental animals to date no study has measured blood or urine levels of BPA in relation to any health outcome in any species. The combined data from these studies will provide the first direct analysis of the effects of BPA exposure on the developing primate fetus and as such will have important implications for humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used compound found in plastics and the lining of cans used for food that has been shown to have deleterious effects on offspring of mice when the pregnant dams are exposed to low doses. This project will measure BPA metabolism in non-pregnant and pregnant monkeys and determine if effects on eggs or ovaries are seen in developing offspring in primates as they are in mice. Because the dose used will be similar to current human blood levels of BPA the results should have direct relevance to human health.      ","579963",

Clinical risk predictors of future diabetes mellitus (DM) are imperfect. A robust set of predictors of at risk individuals is of particular importance because the delay or prevention of type 2 DM may be possible via both behavioral and pharmacological approaches. One new avenue for the identification of novel disease markers is being opened by the global analysis of the human metabolome. An emerging set of technologies based on mass spectrometry enables the monitoring of hundreds of metabolites from biological samples. A second new avenue for the identification of novel risk factors is afforded by genome- wide association studies (GWAS) which have begun to yield robust reproducible genetic associations with type 2 DM. Many of these genetic variants have occurred in heretofore unsuspected pathways. Indeed many variants are not correlated with intermediate glycemic traits such as fasting glucose or insulin. Thus there is an urgent need to characterize the metabolic consequences of these newly discovered genetic variants and to identify additional genetic variants that are more closely related to pathogenic metabolic signatures. We postulate that combining metabolomic genetic and clinical data in human populations will provide a rich opportunity to identify metabolite signatures of those destined to develop overt DM. To achieve this goal we will leverage the unique resources of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) a well- characterized prospective cohort in which GWAS and comprehensive metabolomic profiling are possible. In Specific Aim 1 we will document changes in plasma metabolite levels with glucose loading in individuals with and without insulin resistance. Building upon preliminary studies already performed we will profile 500 plasma metabolites in samples obtained from ~3100 FHS subjects before and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We will then assess the relation of two phenotypes insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance with the change in plasma metabolite levels in response to OGTT. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine whether changes in plasma metabolite concentrations with glucose loading predict the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. We will use multivariable regression to examine the relation between plasma metabolites and 2 endpoints: incident DM and insulin resistance. In Specific Aim 3 we will characterize the genetic determinants of metabolites associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. We will (A) analyze the relation of metabolites identified in Aims 1 and 2 with common genetic variants using GWAS and (B) characterize differences in plasma metabolite concentrations in individuals with and without validated genetic polymorphisms associated with DM. Thus our goal is to identify novel markers of preclinical disease and illuminate pathways contributing to DM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current treatments for diabetes (DM) are only partially successful in part because they are based on limited knowledge of its root causes. Furthermore there is no way to accurately predict who will develop DM thus limiting our ability to intervene effectively. Our goal is to use genetics and other systematic approaches to develop novel markers of preclinical disease and illuminate our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms in DM.        ","609852",

During the first six months of solo driving the crash rate for newly-licensed teen drivers decreases by a factor of five (McCartt Shabanova and Leaf 2003). The only drivers at greater risk of crashing are those eighty years old and older. Perhaps not surprisingly automobile crashes are the leading cause of death for newly-licensed drivers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2004). The problem is an ongoing national tragedy that has continued for far too long. Standard driver education programs which typically involve 30 hours of classroom instruction and ten hours in the vehicle (four hours of observation and six hours behind the wheel) have until recently been the primary way teens learned to drive. Unfortunately evaluations undertaken over the last forty years have shown little effect of such programs on crash rates (Mayhew and Simpson 2002). Graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs are one response to the problem. The GDL programs clearly reduce crash rates among 16 year olds. However newly-licensed drivers obeying the law-alone and during the day-are still over-involved in crashes sometimes being as much as eight times more likely to be in a crash than are older drivers (Langone 2006). There are many reasons that standard driver education programs and GDL programs may not reduce crashes as much as might be expected among drivers obeying the law during the first six months of restricted licensure. Perhaps most obvious is that these efforts do not directly remediate three behaviors that have been hypothesized to be the primary causes of crashes among novice drivers: failures to (a) anticipate hazards (b) maintain attention and (c) control speed appropriately. Unfortunately little is known about whether these differences do indeed exist and if so the exact reasons newly-licensed and experienced drivers may differ from one another in each of these three areas. Until such is known one cannot design training programs that remediate the deficiencies. We are proposing a four year program of theoretical and applied research to address these problems. Phase 1: In the first year we will assess the hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control skills of newly-licensed drivers (teens who have had their restricted license six months or less) on a driving simulator and compare their performance with experienced older (40-55) drivers. Eye movements head movements driver behaviors (e.g. foot on or off the accelerator brake etc.) and vehicle behaviors (e.g. velocity brake pressure) will be monitored. We will determine the extent to which the differences in hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control are due to differences in the knowledge basic vehicle handling skills and task management routines of the two groups of drivers. Phase 2: In the second year we will develop and evaluate on a driving simulator a PC-based training program designed to improve hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control skills of newly-licensed drivers. The evaluations will take place immediately one month and three months after licensure. Phase 3: In the third year we will repeat our evaluation of the PC-based training program only this time evaluating newly-licensed drivers' hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control skills on the open road immediately one month and three months after training. Again eye movements head movements and driver and vehicle behaviors will be monitored.

During the first six months of solo driving the crash rate for newly-licensed teen drivers decreases by a factor of five (McCartt Shabanova and Leaf 2003).

CF is caused by a mutation in a chloride channel gene. Defective clearance of airway mucus related to the underlying chloride channel abnormality predisposes patients with CF to chronic airway infection and inflammation which in turn causes progressive airway damage. It is now well established that CF lung disease begins in infancy frequently prior to the onset of symptoms providing a rationale for early intervention. Inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) has been shown in short-term studies to improve mucociliary clearance and in long term studies to improve lung function decrease the rate of pulmonary exacerbations and improve quality of life in CF patients over 6 years of age. There are no efficacy data in younger CF patients. HS is a particularly attractive agent to study in infants because it improves defective mucociliary clearance an early step in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to the onset of airway infection and inflammation. This proposal is for a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of 7% HS inhaled twice daily for 48 weeks among infants with CF 4 to 15 months of age at enrollment. Our primary hypothesis is that compared to the control agent (isotonic saline) HS will improve hyperinflation and obstructive lung disease as measured by infant lung function testing. The efficacy and safety results generated by the proposed trial may for the first time provide evidence for early initiation of a therapy used widely in older CF patients thereby potentially delaying or preventing devastating airway damage before it becomes irreversible. One hundred and fifty infants ages 4 to 15 months will be enrolled at 16 centers. Study visits will take place at enrollment and weeks 4 12 24 36 and 48 generally in conjunction with routine CF clinic visits. Subjects will undergo lung function testing at enrollment 24 and 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change in the functional residual capacity a measure of hyperinflation from baseline to end of treatment. Additional lung function measures will also be assessed. The secondary endpoint is the time to first pulmonary exacerbation requiring antibiotic therapy. Other clinical endpoints will include changes in weight and height resting respiratory rate and oximetry a standardized cough score and symptoms by parental home report. Safety will be assessed by evaluation of rates of adverse events withdrawal adherence to treatment new isolation of CF pathogens from respiratory cultures; and clinical parameters measured at study visits during the 48-week treatment period. This Clinical Coordinating Center application is submitted in conjunction with a Data Coordinating Center application. This is the lead application. The public health impact of this study could be significant as it may provide the first efficacy and long term safety data on hypertonic saline in infants with CF potentially allowing the use of this promising agent in the youngest CF patients. HS is a particularly attractive agent to study in infants because it improves defective mucociliary clearance an early step in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to the onset of airway infection and inflammation. This would be the first multicenter clinical trial of a pulmonary maintenance therapy specifically in infants with CF and the first to use measures of infant lung function as an endpoint.        ","531674",

While treatment is helpful (Schwartz 2006) 90% of those college students who commit suicide never sought help within their institution (Gallagher 2006). Prevention is a logical response but few broad scale suicide prevention programs targeted specifically toward college students have been tested. Part of the problem is that suicidality is not just the end result of any one disorder   it can be an aspect of a wide variety of problems including drug and alcohol abuse (Mean et al. 2005) affective disorders (Moscicki 2001) anxiety disorders (Sareen Houlahan Cox & Asmundson 2005) thought disorders (Siris 2001) problems in social relationships (Helliwell 2007) and some physical health problems (e.g. Tang & Crane 2006). There is substantial and growing evidence that experiential avoidance -- the tendency to avoid unwanted emotions and negative thoughts -- is a core common process that contributes to the diverse psychological and behavior problems that lead to suicidality and suicide (e.g. Hayes et al. 1996; Hayes Strosahl Wilson Bissett Pistorello et al. 2004). Acceptance and mindfulness-oriented interventions have been shown to reduce experiential avoidance and thereby reduce the common psychological problems that are predictive of suicidality (Hayes et al 2006). This project proposes to evaluate an acceptance and mindfulness-based intervention   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes Strosahl & Wilson 1999) -- in a randomized trial in which 720 18 to 20 year old college freshmen are assigned in three annual waves of 240 students each to receive either ACT or a didactic course on adjustment to the psychological challenges of college life. The impact of the intervention will be assessed on: (a) experiential avoidance (b) a range of psychological behavioral health and academic problems that are known to predict suicidality and (c) the frequency or severity of suicidality self-injury suicide attempts ER visits and other risky behaviors. These processes and outcomes will be monitored for two to three years (depending on the wave of intervention). A preventive intervention for college students could be readily disseminated within the higher education structure suggesting that a successful classroom-based preventative approach could have broad public health implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide and suicidality among the nation's 16 million college students is a substantial public health problem (American College Health Association 2007) that needs to be prevented.

While treatment is helpful (Schwartz 2006) 90% of those college students who commit suicide never sought help within their institution (Gallagher 2006). Prevention is a logical response but few broad scale suicide prevention programs targeted specifically toward college students have been tested. Part of the problem is that suicidality is not just the end result of any one disorder   it can be an aspect of a wide variety of problems including drug and alcohol abuse (Mean et al. 2005) affective disorders (Moscicki 2001) anxiety disorders (Sareen Houlahan Cox & Asmundson 2005) thought disorders (Siris 2001) problems in social relationships (Helliwell 2007) and some physical health problems (e.g. Tang & Crane 2006). There is substantial and growing evidence that experiential avoidance -- the tendency to avoid unwanted emotions and negative thoughts -- is a core common process that contributes to the diverse psychological and behavior problems that lead to suicidality and suicide (e.g. Hayes et al. 1996; Hayes Strosahl Wilson Bissett Pistorello et al. 2004). Acceptance and mindfulness-oriented interventions have been shown to reduce experiential avoidance and thereby reduce the common psychological problems that are predictive of suicidality (Hayes et al 2006). This project proposes to evaluate an acceptance and mindfulness-based intervention   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes Strosahl & Wilson 1999) -- in a randomized trial in which 720 18 to 20 year old college freshmen are assigned in three annual waves of 240 students each to receive either ACT or a didactic course on adjustment to the psychological challenges of college life. The impact of the intervention will be assessed on: (a) experiential avoidance (b) a range of psychological behavioral health and academic problems that are known to predict suicidality and (c) the frequency or severity of suicidality self-injury suicide attempts ER visits and other risky behaviors. These processes and outcomes will be monitored for two to three years (depending on the wave of intervention). A preventive intervention for college students could be readily disseminated within the higher education structure suggesting that a successful classroom-based preventative approach could have broad public health implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide and suicidality among the nation's 16 million college students is a substantial public health problem (American College Health Association 2007) that needs to be prevented.

Our laboratory has established that early acute lung IR injury is dependent on alveolar macrophage activation and TNF-alpha induction. One major anti-inflammatory mechanism in IR is mediated through the release of adenosine and we have showed that activation of the A2A adenosine receptor (AR) reduces lung IR injury. Little is known about the role of other ARs in lung IR injury. Thus Aim 1 will determine the role of each AR in a mouse model of acute lung IR. Aim 2 will establish that A2AARs specifically on alveolar macrophages confer protection from acute lung IR injury. Aim 3 will determine if mechanisms of A2AAR attenuation of IR injury involve MAPK NF-kB and apoptosis pathways in macrophages. Our overall hypothesis is that specific activation of A2AARs on alveolar macrophages provides protection from post-transplant acute lung IR injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung reperfusion injury is a major complication of lung transplantation leading to higher post-operative mortality and late complications including chronic rejection. The objective of this proposal is to better understand the mechanisms of reperfusion injury and potentially prevent this complication.

The underlying hypothesis of this application is that specific miRNAs or families of miRNAs play a role in regulating schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits in mice. The goals of this proposal are threefold: First we will investigate expression patterns of brain-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in NMDA-R- related animal models of schizophrenia. Specifically we will examine in mice the effects of acute or chronic exposure to the non-competitive NMDA-R antagonist and schizomimetic agent MK-801 on miRNA expression in brain regions implicated in schizophrenia in human patients with a focus on prefrontal cortex (PFC). It is predicted that pharmacological and genetic models of schizophrenia in mice will be associated with distinct patterns of dysregulated miRNA expression. Importantly convergent data between pharmacological and genetic models of schizophrenia will provide convergent support for the participation of particular miRNAs or families of miRNAs in schizophrenia-related deficits. Importantly we will examine the effects of agents with known beneficial effects on schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits (haloperidol and clozapine) on the expression of miRNAs shown to be dysregulated in the schizomimetic mouse models. It is predicted that antipsychotic agents with known clinical utility will reverse at least in part dysregulated patterns of miRNA expression in the mouse models of schizophrenia. To more directly assess the roles of identified miRNAs in schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits in mice we will modulate the expression of targeted miRNAs by direct intracerebral infusion of locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified antagomiRs into the brains of mice. The effects of modulating targeted miRNAs in this manner will be assessed on baseline and MK-801-induced behaviors in three procedures that model aspects of schizophrenia-like deficits in mice: hyperlocomotion with stereotyped behaviors; decreases in social interaction; and elevations of intracranial self-stimulation thresholds. It is predicted that miRNAs mediate the expression of schizophrenia-like deficits in mice and that decreasing the expression of targeted miRNAs may attenuate the expression of schizophrenia-like deficits. The experiments proposed in this application promise to yield significant new insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may reveal novel treatment and/or biomarker approaches for schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by impairments in perception or expression of reality by significant social or occupational dysfunction and by profound cognitive impairment. Thus schizophrenia results in tremendous human suffering and negative economic impact on society. Approximately 1% of the population of the United States around 3 million people suffers from schizophrenia. Importantly the underlying etiology of schizophrenia remains largely unknown and there is a marked need for improved treatment paradigms. The proposed work has the potential to aid in the development of completely novel therapeutics.      ","429525",

An estimated 650000 persons were living with HIV in China in 2005 and transmission is shifting from injection drug users to populations at risk through sexual transmission. MSM in particular may be experiencing a rapid rise in HIV prevalence right now. In Beijing HIV prevalence rose from less that 1% in 2004 to over 5% in 2006. HIV prevalence among MSM in Chongqing has already been measured over 15%. While grassroots community- and state- supported prevention programs for MSM are proliferating they generally have not been guided by rigorous epidemiological data or by theory-based prevention approaches. We propose a four year program to progressively improve the theoretical foundation for HIV epidemiological surveys prevention programs and intervention research for MSM in China. The context of our effort will be three serial cross-sectional respondent-driven sampling (RDS) surveys enhanced with specific training in behavioral research formative research to adapt and validate detailed behavioral instruments for China and assessment of the coverage and impact of existing prevention programs for MSM in Beijing and Chongqing. In addition to enhancing our capacity to conduct future large scale randomized controlled trials of HIV prevention interventions the data collected through this proposal will have immediate applications in targeting the factors and behaviors driving HIV transmission among MSM in our country. By virtue of our team's leadership of locally and internationally funded programs for MSM we are poised to rapidly incorporate findings into on-going efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As one of the first study conducted among men who have sex with men the project will help understand HIV/AIDS epidemic among this population in China. It will also help identify high risk group develop suitable survey tool to investigate risk behavior of men who have sex with men as well as evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing programs in study areas.      ","94193",

Deleterious alcohol-related health effects attributed to internal organ toxicity include irreversible brain tissue injury. Brain tissue of chronic alcoholics features neurodegeneration paralleling neuro-cognitive deficits. The causes of HIV-1-associated neurotoxicity clinically manifesting as HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD) include excitotoxic effects of glutamate secretory products of chronically activated glial cells and oxidative stress similar culprits to ones mediating alcohol-induced neuronal injury. Alcohol abuse and HIV-1 infection of central nervous system (CNS) could result in combined toxic effects leading to neuronal demise and cognitive dysfunction. The current grant application is focused on putative mechanisms of enhanced neurotoxicity in the setting of alcohol abuse and HIV-1 CNS infection. Specifically we will study unique aspects of astrocyte dysfunction caused by HIV-1 CNS infection and alcohol abuse. We hypothesize that astrocyte dysfunction caused by alcohol metabolites and oxidative stress results in (1) increased glutamate levels via down regulation of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT-2 the primary astrocyte glutamate scavenger) causing neuronal injury; (2) production of pro-inflammatory factors (via activation of Src kinases and phospholipase A2); and (3) enhanced activity of metalloproteases (MMPs) resulting in loss of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity. We mechanistically address the role of oxidative stress in astrocytes leading to production of pro-inflammatory molecules and impairment of glutamate uptake by astrocytes. Using a combination of in vitro systems an HIVE animal model chronically exposed to alcohol and in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy we will investigate the astrocyte dysfunction as a focal point of combined effects of HIV-1 and alcohol abuse in the CNS. We will address the following questions: (1) What are the underlying mechanisms causing astrocyte pro-inflammatory phenotype in the setting of alcohol abuse and HIV-1 CNS infection that cause activation of MMPs and BBB dysfunction? (Aim 1); (2) What is the role/contribution of enhanced production of reactive oxygen species Rho GTPases and NF-?B signaling in diminished expression and function of EAAT-2 in astrocytes? (Aim 2); (3) How effective are the therapeutics that target oxidative stress and EAAT-2 dysregulation in ameliorating neurotoxicity and BBB impairment in an animal model for HIV-1 encephalitis and alcohol abuse? (Aim 3). Antioxidants and specific signaling inhibitors will be utilized to delineate pathways involved in these effects. We believe that the proposed works are highly significant as they will uncover novel mechanisms involved in the combined effects of HIV-1 and alcohol abuse in the CNS and propose therapeutic approaches based on these investigations.     Public Health Relevance: Alcohol is abused by millions of Americans has long lasting toxic effects on the central nervous system. Clinical studies indicated that alcohol dependence has an additive effect on cognitive deficits associated with HIV-1 infection. Current proposal aims to understand mechanisms of combined effects of HIV-1 and alcohol abuse in the brain and to propose neuroprotective therapies.      ","347975",

As a case in point medical errors persist at a distressing rate and incur enormous costs despite extensive publicity and considerable research. Because healthcare is a complex sociotechnical system these medical errors generally have no simple single cause. Instead the errors typically are the result of system failures that involve many individuals many contributing factors and encompass multiple levels of the health care system. In our previous research we have shown that computational modeling using OrgAhead is a valuable research tool for dealing with these types of complex multi-level problems. Building on that work we propose using a network-based theory of organizations as complex adaptive systems to develop desktop decision support tools and methods that help managers (a) assess their unit's current performance and (b) predict the impact of potential unit innovations to improve targeted safety and quality outcomes. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop a simple virtual environment that allows nurse managers to assess through a dynamic network analysis decision support tool (DyNADS) the organizational health of their patient care units and then engage in strategic planning by using automated ""what-if"" analysis techniques to test on the virtual units the likelihood of potential innovations to improve their actual units' safety and quality outcomes. Specific aims are to:   1. Refine and streamline data collection requirements for DyNADS to fit within the unit management workflow.   2.

The hypothesis describes the sequence of steps whereby use of one class of drug e.g. cigarettes (nicotine) precedes the use of other drugs such as cocaine. We propose to test the Gateway Hypothesis at the molecular level using a mouse model. Our approach is further based on the evidence that addiction shares molecular steps and molecular logic with long-term memory. We will address four specific aims: (1) To determine on a behavioral and transcriptional level whether there is the sequential order between nicotine and cocaine predicted by the Gateway Hypothesis whether this sequence is unidirectional (from nicotine to cocaine) or bidirectional (from cocaine to nicotine) and whether nicotine can also enhance the response to drugs of abuse other that cocaine such as morphine. (2) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which nicotine primes an animal to the effects of cocaine we propose to use gene-chip analysis to selected target regions to survey patterns of mRNA in the striatum particularly the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala. We will use pharmacological analysis to dissect any possible signal transduction pathway that may mediate the priming effects and genetically modified mice to explore some of the selected candidate genes emerging from the screen. (3) To identify molecular mechanisms that might contribute to maintaining the gateway effect we will examine persistent histone acetylation focusing on promoters of FosB and c-Fos using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. (4) To characterize the nature and consequences of adolescent drug exposure in both behavioral and molecular terms we will replicate selected experiments outlined in Aims 1-3 (a) on adolescent mice to compare these results to those obtained on adults and (b) on adult mice preexposed to nicotine or cocaine to identify the consequences of adolescent drug exposure for drug responses in adulthood to the same or different drugs. Preliminary results from pilot studies support the proposed approach. In addition to testing certain fundamental hypotheses for understanding addiction these molecular insights are potentially useful for two reasons: (1) They may provide new molecular targets for the treatment of addiction; (2) They are likely to provide new hypotheses about drug behavior in human populations that can be further explored in epidemiological data. Drug abuse represents one of the most important public health issues in the nation. Drug abuse begins in adolescence with the use of one of the legal drugs alcohol or tobacco (nicotine); those who use one of these drugs are at much greater risk of progressing to the use of illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine. Those who start smoking in adolescence are much more likely to continue smoking as adults and to experience the adverse health consequences of smoking than individuals who start smoking later in life. The proposed research aims to elucidate the biological mechanisms that underlie the progression in drug use from nicotine to cocaine by using a mouse model. The findings of the research may make it possible to develop new drugs to prevent and treat substance abuse.       ","498108",

Pathogens with the ability to establish a chronic or persistent infection have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade and/or modulate the immune response of their hosts. To this selected group of microorganisms belongs Brucella a gram-negative facultative intracellular bacteria that infects a broad range of mammals including humans and is one of the most distributed zoonosis in the world. Brucella abortus the causative agent of bovine brucellosis is still a major animal health problem in several countries and inflicts severe economical losses in endemic areas. Additionally because of its capacity to induce a chronic and debilitating disease in humans and due to the lack of preventive and therapeutic therapies it is classified as a warfare agent. Brucella if not properly treated during the initial phases of the disease establishes a chronic infection and is extremely hard to eliminate. To do so Brucella has evolved a battery of immune evasion mechanisms that are able to tip the immune response to its own advantage but with minor alterations to the host homeostasis. This fine-tuned modulation is an exquisite example of the evolutionary result of a long-standing interaction between this pathogen and its host. The present application aims at studying two novel immune evasion strategies that we have identified in Brucella abortus. These two mechanisms target two different arms of the immune system: B-lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response and Toll-like receptor signaling in dendritic cells a central component of the innate immune response. In the first case we propose to further study a polyclonal B-lymphocyte mitogen involved in the splenocyte anergy induced by Brucella during the acute phase of the infection. In the second case the proposal aims at understanding in detail the function and mode of action of a new group of bacterial proteins with domains homologous to the Tir domains of the Toll-like receptor proteins that are able to interfere and/or modulate the outcome of the innate immune response. The present project will contribute to shed light on certain aspects of the molecular bases underlying the intricate host-pathogen interaction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The bacterium Brucella causes a serious debilitating disease in animals and humans across the world. Our study will shed light on the mechanisms used by this pathogen to evade the immune response opening the way for the development of new therapeutic agents.      ","81000",

Our sample is comprised of 627 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adolescents recruited during their junior year in high school. Using a high risk design we overselected (60%) Ps who scored high on a measure of neuroticism to increase our power to identify risk factors for emotional disorders and allow evaluation of various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress? We now propose to extend data collection for another 4 years by which time most of our sample will be aged 23 to 25 years. By so doing we will extend the goals of the parent grant in several ways. First we will be able to study risk factors for emotional disorders whose average age of onset peaks after the original window of 16   20 years. Second we will be better able to evaluate risk factors for course severity and comorbidity among the emotional disorders. Third by repeating risk measurement we will be able to evaluate stability/plasticity in risk and its relationship to the onset course and comorbidity of emotional disorders. In addition we propose several new directions. First we propose to evaluate the relationship between genetic markers (DRD4 5HTT and markers of coping) and emotional disorders especially the interaction between genetic markers and indices of episodic and chronic life stress and the hypothesized role of personality traits in mediating the associations between the genetic markers and emotional disorders. Also we propose to evaluate potential candidate genetic markers of coping styles that have been hypothesized to decrease risk for emotional disorders. Second we propose to evaluate personality pathology and its moderation of psychopathology over the period of transition into adulthood. We will also test whether attainment of developmental milestones associated with young adulthood and whether changes in normal personality traits common in young adulthood are predicted by earlier personality trait levels and emotional disorders and are predictors of later emotional disorders. Furthermore we propose additional risk variables of early adversity perceived control coping style and rumination.      ","332193",

With a specific focus on adult anorexia nervosa (AN) we propose to unite the expertise of a team skilled in the treatment of AN with world leaders in the development of couple-based interventions to develop an innovative intervention for couples in which one member is suffering from AN. The intervention ""UCAN: Uniting Couples (in the treatment of) Anorexia Nervosa"" acknowledges that AN occurs in an interpersonal context both being affected by the person's social environment and impacting important interpersonal relationships. Moreover the demonstrated success of family therapy for younger individuals with AN underscores the importance of leveraging family support in the treatment of AN. UCAN tailors cognitive-behavioral couple-based interventions that have been employed successfully for the treatment of depression anxiety disorders smoking cessation and cancer to address the core psychopathology of AN while also addressing the unique and challenging stresses that AN places on intimate relationships. Our initial conceptualization of the intervention focuses first on addressing AN within the context of the relationship with foci such as altering interactions around eating and weight normalizing activity and health behaviors body image physical affection and sexuality and second on addressing the broader relationship to maintain treatment gains prevent relapse and foster relationship satisfaction. The specific aims are: 1) to develop and standardize a manualized intervention for couples in which one member suffers from AN; 2) to determine feasibility and acceptability of a beta- version of UCAN in an open trial as an augmentation to treatment as usual (TAU) and to refine UCAN based on feedback from the preliminary trial; 3) to test UCAN+TAU versus TAU in a randomized controlled trial of 24 couples in which one member has AN; and 4) to adapt an observational couples assessment measure with the eventual goal of incorporating biological measures of affiliation and stress. Our primary patient outcomes will be BMI and global improvement and our secondary patient outcomes will be depression anxiety and relationship adjustment and communication. Partner outcomes will also include caregiving measures. This trial will be designed explicitly to gather preliminary outcome data to inform sample size and power calculations for a subsequent larger randomized controlled trial. Findings from this investigation have the potential to result in the creation of an effective acceptable developmentally tailored intervention that will improve both core AN pathology as well as couple functioning. Future extensions of the intervention will include couple-based interventions for eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. We propose to develop a couple-based intervention for adults with anorexia nervosa entitled ""UCAN: Uniting Couples (in the treatment of) Anorexia Nervosa."" We will create an effective acceptable developmentally tailored intervention that leverages the support of partners to improve both core anorexia nervosa pathology as well as couple functioning.      ","313374",

In the body soft connective tissues must withstand the physical forces that are created by physiological processes and by movement in every day life. Collagenous extracellular matrix provides tensile load bearing properties in all soft connective tissues. In some connective tissues such as skin and blood vessel extracellular elastin also contributes recoil in response to tensile strain. If we are to engineer functional connective tissues ""from scratch"" then it is crucial to understand the deposition and remodeling of extracellular matrix proteins particularly collagen and elastin. Only by fundamentally understanding the processes that govern matrix formation in regenerative medicine can we successfully design functional connective tissues. While multiple investigators have successfully engineered individual tissues with good mechanical properties we currently possess no tools for a more global understanding of the process of matrix formation. Mathematical models for matrix synthesis and mechanics and bioreactor systems that allow imaging of matrix deposition are not readily at hand. Indeed the focus of the NIH PAR 06-504 ""Enabling Technologies for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine"" is on the development of just such tools. In this application we will exploit and develop novel mathematical models bioreactors and non- invasive imaging systems to predict track and quantify the deposition of extracellular matrix in vitro. The goal of this work is to generate novel yet translatable tools for understanding extracellular matrix formation. These tools in turn will fundamentally advance our abilities to grow connective tissues for regenerative medicine. The imaging bioreactor and modeling approaches developed in this application will be directly translatable to other laboratories that are working in these areas. In order to ensure broad applicability of the tools created herein we will use mathematical models novel bioreactors and imaging systems to study matrix deposition in two commonly used tissue engineering systems: planar hydrogel scaffolds and tubular mesh scaffolds. Planar hydrogel scaffolds will be used as a model of sheet-like connective tissues such as fascia and ligament. Tubular mesh scaffolds will be used as a model of tubular connective tissues such as blood vessels. In both of these experimental systems we will apply novel bioreactors and non-invasive microscopy techniques and will couple experimental design and observations with computational models of extracellular matrix formation in order to advance our understanding of the deposition and remodeling of matrix proteins. The purpose of these studies is to develop broad generalizable tools for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. While methods for growing tissues have advanced our abilities to predict how tissues will develop and our abilities to monitor tissue growth remain very limited. In this application we will develop sophisticated mathematical models non-invasive imaging techniques and novel bioreactors that will allow us to precisely control and predict how new tissues will grow.

Spliceosomal RNAs and proteins are critical for eukaryotic gene expression yet little is understood about their structure and function. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the structures of highly conserved RNA complexes and ribonucleoproteins from the spliceosome and understand how the structures change throughout the splicing cycle. Aim 1 is to investigate the structure and function of the U6 RNA-Prp24 ribonucleoprotein complex. Prp24 protein tightly binds to U6 RNA in the free U6 snRNP and is required for U6 RNA structural remodeling during spliceosome assembly and activation. We recently solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal two-thirds of Prp24 and defined a putative U6 RNA binding surface by NMR. The structure of U6 RNA will be determined alone and in complex with Prp24 using both NMR and X- ray studies. These data will reveal how Prp24 remodels the U6 RNA structure to facilitate pairing with U4 RNA during spliceosome assembly and with U2 RNA during spliceosome activation. In vitro biochemical and in vivo genetic studies will be used to further probe the mechanism by which Prp24 acts as a U6 RNA chaperone. Aim 2 of the proposal is to determine the structure of the U2-U6 RNA complex. The U2-U6 complex resides within the catalytic core of the spliceosome and directly hydrogen bonds to the pre-mRNA substrate in the active site. Furthermore the human U2-U6 complex has residual catalytic activity in the absence of proteins. For this aim we have identified a well-folded fragment of U2-U6 RNA that maintains tertiary structure and is amenable to NMR structure determination. As a sub-aim we will collaboratively develop new methods for refining large multi-domain RNA NMR structures against small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data and pseudo-CSA restraints. We expect these methods will be of general utility for structure determination of large macromolecules in solution. Prp24 binds to the U2-U6 RNA construct and we will attempt to determine the structure of this ribonucleoprotein complex which may mimic a true intermediate in spliceosome activation and/or disassembly. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the allosteric cascade that drives spliceosome assembly activation catalysis and disassembly.Narrative     The spliceosome is an intricate cellular machine composed of 5 RNAs and more than 75 proteins. The spliceosome is so vital to the cell that even a subtle defect in just one of its components results in the disease retinitis pigmentosa which causes blindness. Our work will result in a better understanding of the mechanism by which this remarkable molecular machine processes messenger RNA so that proteins can be made correctly by cells.      ","273585",

In this system the transcription factor Gal4 binds to specific DNA sequences upstream of target genes to activate their transcription. By introducing these upstream activating sequences (UAS) next to a minimal promoter and any gene of interest high levels of expression are obtained in the presence of Gal4. Other regulatory components include Gal80 a repressor that binds to Gal4 and limits its activity. By building both temporal and spatial control into the GAl4/UAS system for the fly any gene can be induced in a given cell or tissue at a given time. This powerful approach has not only enhanced developmental studies and the generation of new disease models but has provided insights into how neurons mediate complex behaviors in the adult brain. The goal of the proposed work is to expand upon and optimize the versatile Gal4/UAS system for the vertebrate model the zebrafish. In initial studies a new vector was produced that integrates throughout the zebrafish genome by transposition thereby placing the Gal4 gene under the control of adjacent tissue-specific enhancers. Moreover these gene/enhancer traps could activate other genes under UAS control including fluorescent reporters of sub-cellular structure and effectors of cell death. Numerous researchers have requested plasmid constructs and the Gal4 driver and UAS reporter transgenic lines produced from this work. While robust tissue-restricted expression is routinely achieved now in zebrafish there is no reliable method to control gene expression temporally. Several approaches have been successfully used in Drosophila and will be tested for their efficacy to induce Gal4 activity in transgenic zebrafish. Some recovered transgenic lines show pronounced transcriptional silencing at the level of the UAS. Another aim of this study is to take advantage of these insertions to gain a greater understanding of how UAS regulated genes are silenced with the goal of designing new transgenic vectors less susceptible to transcriptional repression. In addition a battery of new tools under UAS control will be produced that will have broad utility in observing cellular morphology real-time in long-term lineage studies and in mapping neuronal connectivity in the brain. The proposed collection of tools will bring a new and much needed versatility to zebrafish experimentation and as with our first set of Gal4/UAS transgenic lines will serve as a valuable resource for the research community.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to manipulate gene expression in time and space using the Gal4/UAS transcriptional activation system of yeast revolutionized experimental approaches in the Drosophila model. Versatile Gal4-based methods allow researchers to visualize subsets of cells or sub-cellular structures with fluorescent markers to monitor processes that underlie organ formation real-time to asses protein function in selective tissues or cells and to discover new genes acting in genetic pathways. The application of this methodology to zebrafish has unlimited potential and is sorely needed to address processes beyond early development such as adult physiology and behavior. The proposed experiments are aimed at continuing a productive collaborative effort between three research groups to generate new Gal4/UAS transgenic tools for regulated gene expression in the zebrafish. An additional goal is to optimize the Gal4/UAS system by exploring the basis of transcriptional silencing of zebrafish transgenes and devising approaches to overcome it.      ","332400",

Our laboratories have focused on the design and development of nanomaterials to achieve this purpose. For example the Reed laboratory has developed a semiconductor solid-state technology using CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor)-FET (field effect transistor) technology a critical step in system-scale integration of these sensors into standard electronics. These devices are amenable to chemical surface modification and are highly sensitive to bound molecular charge enabling rapid label-free detection (within seconds) of femtomolar concentrations of DNA and proteins in solution. In addition these new devices enable sensing of stimulus induced extracellular acidification of a minute number of cells in microliter volumes. The Fahmy laboratory is focused on the application of novel biomaterials to detection and modulation of the immune response. Here this combination of experience will be focused on the optimization and testing of these nanosensors as a diagnostic for detection of antigens antibodies and antigen-responsive lymphocytes. Our application aims to demonstrate the utility of this technology for cancer diagnostic applications. Our working hypothesis is that nanoscale CMOS wires can be developed as rapid quantitative diagnostic devices of soluble antigens as well as the immune response to those antigens. To test this hypothesis we propose to: 1) Fabricate integrated semiconducting nanosensors incorporating on-chip fluidics for high throughput sampling capability. 2) Optimize chemical surface modification of these sensors for ligand binding and test the limits of sensitivity of the sensor for detection of cancer markers and production of vaccine-mediated antibodies. 3) Demonstrate the utility of this system in the detection of antigen- specific lymphocyte responses and tumor-associated vaccine response. Because the strength of the approach lies in a novel fabrication scheme of nanowires and seamless integration with CMOS technology our approach facilitates wide use in basic and diagnostic clinical settings requiring sensitive and high-throughput screening of samples.     Relevance Statement: We have developed a novel technology to synthesizing nanowires (NWs) allowing their direct integration with microelectronic systems for the first time as well as their ability to act as highly sensitive biomolecule detectors that could revolutionize biological diagnostic applications. Our proposed work outlines a research plan for the development of the next generation portable electronic nanosensor and demonstrates its application in the read-out of cancer biomarkers and the immune response. These nanosensors can replace current technology with a powerful solid-state device useful for rapid diagnosis in clinical settings.      ","364928",

Ultrasound therapy is currently used clinically to promote bone healing and has been shown to enhance soft tissue repair. Some biological effects of ultrasound are known to result from the mechanical forces associated with acoustic wave propagation. In vitro studies demonstrate that mechanical stresses positively affect both extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cell behavior. Thus we hypothesize that acoustically-driven mechanical forces can be used to control ECM deposition and promote cell and tissue function. In this proposal we combine our knowledge of ECM biology and biomedical ultrasound to develop ultrasound-based enabling technologies for the fabrication and monitoring of functional 3D ECM and tissue analogs. To accomplish this goal we have developed four specific aims. In Aim 1 we will use ultrasound fields to fabricate ECM FN and collagen analogs and optimize ultrasound exposure conditions that enhance ECM-mediated fibroblast and epithelial cell growth. In Aim 2 we will develop the use of acoustically-driven mechanical forces to promote fibroblast migration into 3D collagen- based tissue constructs. In Aim 3 we will use acoustic fields to stimulate ECM organization in order to engineer the biological and material properties of collagen-based tissue constructs. In Aim 4 we will apply and extend our experience in ultrasound tissue characterization technologies to non-destructively quantify mechanical and biological properties of engineered tissues in real-time. We envision immense potential for the use of ultrasound technologies to provide break-through technologies for tissue fabrication and monitoring. Furthermore the ability of ultrasound to propagate through tissue as a focused beam has the potential to provide a revolutionary approach to locally regulate and monitor tissue regeneration deep within the body. Tissue engineering is a potentially revolutionary approach for replacing or regenerating diseased or destroyed organs and tissues. The current lack of available tissue analogs reflects an inability to create 3-D scaffolds that have both biological activity and adequate mechanical strength. We will develop ultrasound- based enabling technologies with the dual capacity to (i) create biologically-active 3-D tissue constructs for tissue engineering and (ii) non-invasively monitor the biological and mechanical properties of these constructs.

The dominant cause is acute rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques but no test is currently available to non-invasively identify vulnerable plaques during the asymptomatic stage. The quantum leap needed to address this profound health issue and the goal of this proposal is to develop a non-invasive technique that detects vulnerable plaques prior to rupture. Extravasation of erythrocytes and intra-plaque hemorrhage are considered critical factors in the transition of a plaque from the stable to unstable state. As a consequence iron a main component of red blood cells accumulates in the artery wall and its presence indicates impending rupture. A major challenge in using iron as an imaging marker of vulnerable plaque is the concurrent presence of calcium. Unlike iron coronary calcifications represent overall plaque burden rather than vulnerability. The great problem resulting from the co-localization of iron and calcium in individual plaques is that they are indistinguishable on both magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray computed tomography (CT) the two most accepted modalities for non-invasive imaging of coronary arteries. To solve this problem we have recently applied dual-energy CT which subtracts images acquired with substantially different energy spectra to discriminate materials that appear similar on conventional CT such as iron and calcium.     Based on our successful preliminary work our central hypothesis is therefore that dual-energy CT can directly detect vulnerable plaques in vivo by virtue of iron accumulation in the artery wall. Our objective during Phase I of this Quantum Program is to detect iron as a marker of vulnerable plaques despite the presence of calcium. The specific aims are (1): To develop an imaging technique that can detect iron and discriminate iron from calcium. Our working hypothesis is that CT images simultaneously acquired using a new dual-source CT system at two different x-ray tube potentials can be combined to unequivocally differentiate iron from calcium. We will use mixtures of iron and calcium solutions and sub-mm particles as well as explanted specimens of diseased vessels. Aim (2) is designed to measure intramural iron in vulnerable plaques of arterial specimens and in vivo. a) Using high resolution dual-energy microscopic CT (micro-CT) we will quantify the prevalence concentration and distribution of iron deposits in vulnerable plaques. b) Finally we will validate our dual-energy techniques in vivo using a diabetic pig model that develops unstable atherosclerotic lesions similar to patients. Histological techniques will be used to classify plaque stages.     In Phase II we will build a new generation of CT technology with the performance characteristics necessary to accurately detect hemorrhagic plaque in humans. The significance of this proposal is that by detecting and treating pre-symptomatic vulnerable plaques before they rupture the premature death loss of productivity hospitalization and treatment cost to society can be markedly reduced.      ","711522",

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. Androgen action and the functional status of the AR are believed to be the important mediators of prostate cancer development. Although androgen/AR is known to promote growth of androgen-dependent prostate tumors its function in tumor metastasis is unclear at present. A preliminary study has been made in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mouse models of prostate cancer and discovered that ablation of the AR in prostate epithelium resulted in development of larger pelvic lymph node (PLN) metastatic tumors and higher numbers of liver metastatic foci suggesting that AR might function as a suppressor of prostate tumor metastasis. Therefore the proposed studies will use various ARKO models of TRAMP mice and human prostate cancer cell lines with different AR expression to investigate the suppressor role of AR in prostate tumor metastasis. Initially prostate epithelium-specific (pes) AR knockout (ARKO) (Aim 1) and inducible ARKO TRAMP mice (Aim 2) will be generated to study the effect of pes-ARKO and induction of ARKO after prostate tumors have developed on PLN metastatic tumor formation and growth as well as the expression levels of various metastasis-related genes. Subsequently the effect of suppressing AR expression (with AR-specific RNA interference) in AR-positive and restoring AR expression (with functional AR cDNA) in AR-negative PLN tumor cells and various human prostate cancer cell lines (Aim 3) on their invasive properties and expression levels of metastasis-related genes will be studied in vitro as well as in bone xenografts in SCID mice. Finally the molecular mechanisms through which AR regulates the expression levels of various metastasis-related genes will be studied (Aim 4). Therefore the success of this application undoubtedly will uncover an alterative role of the AR as a metastasis suppressor during prostate cancer progression. The establishment of the AR function as a metastasis suppressor and understanding of how it regulates tumor metastasis-related genes should lead to new concepts of treatment modality and molecular targeting for prostate cancer therapy.   Project Narrative: Loss of Androgen Receptor Promotes Metastatic Cancer. We will study the loss of androgen receptor in prostate epithelium and the influence of this loss on prostatic metastatic tumor invasion. The success of this application undoubtedly will uncover an alterative role of the androgen receptor as a metastasis suppressor during prostate cancer progression. The establishment of the androgen receptor function as a metastasis suppressor and understanding of how it regulates tumor metastasis-related genes should lead to new concepts of treatments and molecular targets for prostate cancer therapy.        ","292600",

The three principal investigators on this multiple-Principal Investigator proposal have each established the Targeting Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) methodology for identifying N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations in specific genes of interest in zebrafish using Cel1 detection and have used this approach to identify nonsense or splice site mutations predictive of strong or complete loss of function of 43 genes. The approach involves screening for unique mutations in a large library of randomly ENU-mutagenized cryopreserved fish that has been built independently in each of our labs. We wish to make these valuable resources available to the zebrafish community. In this 3-year grant we propose to identify loss-of-function mutations (defined for our purposes as mutations that create premature stop codons or that disrupt splice sites) in 120 genes of interest to the members of the zebrafish community and to make them available via submission to the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC). Establishing a TILLING consortium between the three groups reduces redundancy of effort and increases the chances of identifying deleterious mutations in target genes. Whereas separately our libraries are predicted to contain loss-of-function mutations in between 20% and 58% of the genes we screen combined they are expected to contain loss-of-function mutations in over 80% of targets. In Aim 1 we propose to screen target genes sequentially at the three locations until one or more loss-of-function mutations are identified. Potential TILLING targets will be submitted by members of the community and will be ranked by a 10-member external advisory board according to criteria such as high biomedical relevance and inaccessibility to other reverse genetics methods. In Aim 2 we propose to recover these mutants to do a preliminary phenotypic characterization and to provide them first to the requester and then within six months of recovery to the wider zebrafish community via ZIRC. Finally in Aim 3 we propose to explore massively parallel sequencing of PCR-amplified targets from our ENU-mutagenized libraries as a higher-throughput alternative to our current TILLING methodology.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vertebrate model organisms such as the zebrafish in which gene function can be understood through the detailed analysis of mutant phenotypes provide important insights into mechanisms of human development and disease. In the past grant period we adapted TILLING a methodology to find mutations in genes of interest to the zebrafish and built resources that can allow us to find loss-of-function mutations in a large fraction of the genes in the zebrafish genome. We now propose to use TILLING to identify mutations in 120 genes that are of importance to biomedical research and to make these mutants available to the zebrafish community as rapidly as possible.      ","704606",

We examine the intersection and mutual influence of three factors-socioeconomic status (SES) cognitive ability and health itself. Extant research has demonstrated amply that indicators of SES predict health outcomes that health affects socioeconomic attainment and that cognitive ability predicts both educational attainment and health. But how do such associations between SES cognitive ability and health arise over the life course? And what role does racial discrimination play in influencing each of these factors to create disparities by race? A theory of dynamic interplay of these factors across the life course is posited to explain the emergence of racial and socioeconomic disparities in general health obesity respiratory function and depression. A California-based cohort the Child Health and Development Study-Adolescent Sample (CHDS-A) (n=2020) born 1959-1966 provides the novel data to evaluate this theory. Detailed information was collected at multiple time points from before birth until age 15-17 years for black and white offspring and their families. Sufficient numbers of black and white offspring from both high and low SES families were included in the sample. The data already collected include assessments during childhood and adolescence of SES cognitive ability and the selected domains of health. This project will add assessments at age 42-49 years. Analysis of the accumulated data will elucidate the relationships among fundamental sources of health disparities and inform the construction of policies and interventions designed to reduce such inequalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities by socioeconomic status and race represent major public health issues in need of resolution. This study will provide novel data from a bi-racial birth cohort that has been intensively followed through adolescence and is now in middle-age adulthood. The analysis of key data collected in the proposed study will create an unusual opportunity to understand when and why health disparities emerge over the life course and further guidance for shaping the content and timing of interventions to ameliorate observed disparities.      ","575616",

However one major limitation to its widespread use is the absence of a technology that allows direct genomic manipulation of a desired target gene either to inactivate or alter its function. Recent studies in human cell lines insects and plants indicate that site-specific mutations can be introduced using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs). Using a combination of rational design and selection we have successfully engineered ZFNs that promote targeted gene disruption in zebrafish that are transmissible through the germline. Using this technology it is now possible to generate targeted mutations throughout the zebrafish genome. In this grant proposal we propose to optimize and extend the use of ZFNs in zebrafish. A major goal of the proposed studies will be to enable individual researchers to generate knockout or knock-in zebrafish lines in their own laboratories with modest technical effort. We will streamline the creation of site- specific zinc finger proteins   the targeting component of ZFNs   to simplify the process of making gene knockouts. We will further utilize and optimize ZFN technology for targeted homologous recombination with a DNA donor supplied in trans allowing targeted gene knock-ins. We will demonstrate the utility of this technology by making conditional alleles of genes involved in heart regeneration to allow the study of knockouts of required genes in the adult. We will also generate an allelic series of mutations in the flt4 receptor tyrosine kinase to better understand its role at multiple steps in vascular development. By providing an accessible technological platform for genetic manipulation to the zebrafish community this study will ultimately enable the creation of a variety of gene knockouts or knock-ins that can be used in conjunction with powerful forward and reverse genetic screens in the zebrafish to study human disease models. Thus the development and use of ZFN technology in the zebrafish will have far- reaching significance in virtually all areas of biomedical research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing technology to allow the genome of the zebrafish to be engineered. This technology will allow researchers to construct models of human disease in this animal to understand its origin and develop better treatments. We will apply this technology in zebrafish to better understand the processes involved in heart regeneration and blood vessel formation.      ","414237",

The resource will be named CZECH the Center for Zebrafish Epigenetics and CHromatin. Chromatin regulates gene expression and impacts development by influencing the transcriptional programs that drive cell growth and fate decisions. DNA methylation and other chromatin marks (defined as the epigenome) strongly influence the timing and strength of expression of particular genes during development but a systematic study has not been performed in any organism. Furthermore misregulation of transcription via chromatin underlies many developmental defects and certain cancers. Thus we must understand how chromatin dynamics help guide development. The Center will address this issue using a combination of genomic and genetic approaches will provide detailed protocols for genomic approaches and will deploy and manage a database for the community to view and submit datasets. Here we will define the basic epigenome of germ cells and the early embryo of the zebrafish both before and during organ specification. We will combine chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with high-density genome tiling arrays (to examine chromatin) and also perform gene expression profiling. We will initially limit our examination to the chromatin modifications most closely associated with transcriptional repression (DNA methylation H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) or transcriptional activation (H3K4me3) which include the `bivalent' modifications important for poising genes in stem cells. Notably our preliminary studies suggest the poising of early developmental regulators in sperm chromatin by DNA hypomethylation. In later stage embryos we will use FACS to isolate developing tissues and then determine their epigenome.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses how chromosomes and their resident genes are packaged in germ cells and then change their packaging following fertilization to regulate gene expression during early development. This process is central to understanding how cells differentiate how organs develop and how cell growth is regulated. The misregulation of chromosome and gene packaging leads to problems such as birth defects retardation or cancer depending on the particular chromosome(s) or gene(s) affected.      ","319813",

ALI is a syndrome causing respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). This syndrome is caused by a diverse group of both pulmonary (e.g. aspiration) and non-pulmonary (e.g. sepsis) risk factors. ALI imposes a significant public health burden with a higher incidence than previously recognized and a total number of deaths similar to breast cancer or HIV infection. As the short-term mortality rate for ALI has improved greater attention has focused on the significant longer-term morbidities faced by the growing number of ALI survivors. At present there is inadequate knowledge regarding long-term outcomes of ALI survivors and little known about the effect of ICU therapies on these outcomes. This proposed ancillary study will evaluate the 6- and 12-month outcomes of 3 new ARDSNet trials. These trials are testing the efficacy of 3 interventions (nebulized albuterol vs. placebo anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant nutritional supplement vs. placebo and delayed vs. early full-calorie enteral feeding) on patients' short-term survival and liberation from mechanical ventilation. We will evaluate ALI survivors' overall quality of life and their major long-term physical cognitive and mental health morbidities. Specifically we will determine the effect of the 3 ICU therapies being tested in these trials on (1) patient-reported long-term outcomes via phone- based surveys of survivors from all 12 ARDSNet study sites (Aims 1a 2a and 3a); and (2) clinical outcomes which may mediate the patient-reported outcomes via in-person evaluations of survivors from a subset of 4 ARDSNet sites participating in this ancillary study (Aims 1b 2b and 3b). All of these outcome assessments will not otherwise be conducted in the parent trials but represent invaluable knowledge in evaluating the health status of ALI survivors and the long-term effect of the 3 therapies under study. All phone surveys for participants will be centralized at 2 of the 4 study sites in this proposal using validated instruments for assessing physical capabilities cognitive function and mental health as recommended by the ARDSNet Long-Term Outcomes Committee. Detailed in-person evaluations of physical and cognitive function will be performed at the 4 study sites participating in this proposal. This in-person evaluation of physical function will be conducted using standard clinical tests of overall physical function pulmonary function muscle strength and anthropometrics. In-person evaluation of cognitive function will include use of validated instruments for assessing orientation attention memory reasoning and executive function.     Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (""ALI"") causes life-threatening breathing problems requiring the use of a mechanical ventilator (artificial respirator) in an intensive care unit (ICU). This syndrome occurs more frequently than previously recognized and kills more Americans than breast cancer or HIV infection; however an improvement in the mortality rate from ALI has led to a growing number of people surviving this syndrome. Our study aims to better understand ALI survivors' quality of life and their major physical cognitive and mental health outcomes at 6- and 12-months after ALI and to determine if treatments being tested in three new National Institutes of Health clinical trials can improve these outcomes.

Despite its overall success at restoring immune function and often cognitive function in demented HIV-1-infected persons highly active antiretroviral therapy has limited effects upon milder CNS disease that is increasingly prevalent. Based on our findings of treatment independent significant gene dysregulation in brains of patients with minor cognitive and motor disorder (MCMD) we hypothesize that there are core changes in brain physiology arising from long-lived infected cells that persist through existing therapies which were not designed to arrest expression of integrated provirus. Unabated production of viral proteins by these cells can cause cumulative inflammatory antiviral and oxidative stress reactions that affect neuronal function. To test this hypothesis as well as one mechanism underlying the core defect we propose four Specific Aims to: 1) establish genome-wide brain gene expression profiles representative of patients with milder forms of HIV CNS disease; 2) identify biological pathways and biomarkers in the brain characteristic of continuing mild HIV CNS disease in the presence of antiretroviral treatment; 3) validate selected markers of mild HIV CNS disease in a mouse model of HIV infection in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice; 4) test the hypothesis that mild chronic HIV CNS disease depends upon low level virus transcription unaffected by existing antiretroviral treatment. We rely upon brain tissue from well defined patient cohorts assembled by Dr. S. Morgello gene discovery through genome wide expression analysis and bioinformatics confirmatory studies including pathways of oxidative stress visible in lipid metabolites with Dr. Haughey and a robust experimental model of HIV infection in mice that reproduces many features of mild CNS disease. Using chimeric HIV that can infect mice and is amenable to genetic modification we shall test one causal hypothesis for mild CNS disease: low-level virus transcription that persists in the brain despite effective therapy maintains dysregulation of brain cell physiology that is expressed as MCMD. If these studies demonstrate that low level HIV-1 expression impairs cellular function in the brain despite antiviral treatment efforts should be directed toward development of new antiviral agents to block viral transcription from cellular reservoirs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Medical science has prolonged life and improved health of HIV-infected people through development of effective antiviral drugs. Nevertheless some aspects of HIV disease persist despite treatment one of these leads to functional abnormalities in the brain and central nervous system. We propose to determine the molecular bases of this mild but significant and persistent brain disease using state-of-the-art gene discovery and lipid metabolomics tools. Once confirmed in human beings we shall use these markers of mild brain disease to test whether a similar disease caused by HIV infection of mice persists in the presence of drug treatment even when the virus infection begins in the brain. Finally we shall ask questions about the origin of mild brain disease in HIV infected people with effective therapy by establishing an experimental HIV infection in the brains of mice that is silent until it is turned on. By turning on and off this brain HIV we shall determine whether it is residual HIV expression itself that causes the mild disease in the brain that cannot be controlled by existing drugs. This research may lead to two recommendations for control of the HIV CNS impairment that persists under current HAART regimes: a) earlier antiviral intervention relative to seroconversion than it is customary today; b) a call to the scientific and pharmaceutical communities to develop anti-HIV drugs that stop HIV expression.      ","481627",

In this ecological setting transmission of Schistosoma haematobium Plasmodium spp. filarial nematodes and geohelminths is common resulting in high levels of human urinary schistosomiasis malaria lymphatic filariasis and hookworm infection. These infections because of their combined long-term effects appear to play a significant but as yet incompletely defined synergistic role in the causation of chronic clinical and subclinical human disease and poverty. In this context transmission patterns and risk factors for these diverse parasitic infections often appear to be linked and to overlap extensively. However to date most studies have not approached the complexity of multi-parasite ecology because of limitations on data availability and accuracy and because of variable heterogeneities of infection risk that are found across physical and social space and over time. The project's underlying hypothesis is that environmental factors are the key determinants of transmission potential for these parasites and that these interact with demographic and socio-economic factors in determining the observed spatial/demographic patterns of parasitic disease. Recent research findings on parasite eco-epidemiology indicate that these effects all need to be reconsidered on multiple levels-individual household village and district-wide-separately for each parasite and for the combined suite of infections. Transmission processes and disease patterns vary across these multiple levels and will also vary spatially and temporally within each level. The combined impact of these endemic infections has not been well studied and may prove to have additive or more complex non-linear interactive effects. Consequently optimal control strategies may prove to require local reduction of both transmission (preventing infection) and disease manifestations through the integrated targeting of one some or all of these parasitic infections in concert. Specific Aims of this project are to detect spatial and demographic patterns of transmission and infection for schistosomiasis malaria filariasis and hookworms in coastal Kenya through integration of parasitological data with landscape land use and socioeconomic risk factors; to develop network- and individual-based models to identify the critical features of transmission and predict the potential impact of integrated control programs on distribution of malaria filaria schistosomes and hookworm and their related community disease impact; and strengthen training in infectious disease ecology for health problems in Africa.      ","488208",

The proposal is based on behavioral experiments where we show that microinfusion of both 1 and 2 adrenergic antagonists confined to the olfactory bulb interferes with the ability of mice to discriminate between structurally related odors. In addition we present patch clamp experiments in olfactory bulb slices that show both acute and long term effects of noradrenaline on mitral cell function that likely underlie the effect of the adrenergic antagonists in vivo. We hypothesize that noradrenaline modulates odor responsiveness and mitral cell action potential firing and that these changes in mitral cell function contribute to the behavioral discrimination of closely related odors. In order to test this hypothesis we will utilize the powerful techniques of assessment of olfactory ability through computer-assisted operant conditioning and adrenergic receptor pharmacology with patch clamp studies of modulation of mitral cell function in olfactory bulb slices.     Two aims are proposed. Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that centrifugal noradrenergic modulation of olfactory bulb function is necessary for discrimination of closely related odors.     Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that noradrenaline modulates cellular properties and mitral cell spike activity in mouse olfactory bulb slices. This interdisciplinary approach will allow us to critically assess the cellular and synaptic basis of modulation of olfactory behavior by noradrenergic modification of olfactory bulb function.7. Project Narrative. In humans disorders of the sense of smell are encountered in diseases such as Alzheimer's (Doty 1991;Rawson 2000) bipolar depression (Hahn et al. 2005) and schizophrenia (Turetsky et al. 2003). This grant will study noradrenergic modulation of olfactory bulb function. The study of noradrenergic modulation is relevant to schizophrenia (Yamamoto and Hornykiewicz 2004) whose etiology we study in the Restrepo laboratory.      ","332295",

However methods of treatment are variable and re-injury rates tend to be high which in part reflects a lack of fundamental understanding of the factors that influence injury risk. The prevailing theory is that injury occurs as a result of excessive strain of active muscle fibers. The goal of this study is to develop novel biocomputational tools to predict and analyze the strain distributions within skeletal muscles during movements associated with injury. Model predictions will be compared with strain measures obtained using state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging experiments. Once validated we will use the biocomputational tools to investigate how morphology and coordination influence hamstring injury risk during running. Following are the specific aims. Aim 1 will use a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging technique to measure the strain distributions within the individual hamstring muscles during lengthening contractions a loading condition commonly associated with injury. Comparisons between muscles will provide new insights into the propensity for hamstring injury to occur in the biceps femoris long head. Aim 2 will build a biocomputational framework to predict muscle strain distributions during movement. The framework will couple finite-element simulations of muscle tissue behavior with dynamic simulations of whole body movement. The methods will be validated by comparing strain predictions with those determined from the dynamic images in Aim 1. We will then use the framework to investigate the relationship between muscle excitations hamstring tissue strains and skeletal movement during running. Aim 3 will evaluate whether computational models predict re-injury prevention strategies. We will build and validate models of subjects who exhibit residual changes in tissue structures as a result of a previous hamstring injury. We will then use the software framework to identify how movement coordination can be adapted to accommodate injury-induced changes in morphology. This research will establish a biocomputational framework that reveals the complex relationship between muscle morphology coordination and injury risk thus providing a new paradigm for identifying rehabilitation and injury prevention strategies. Muscle strain injuries are one of the most common conditions seen in sports medicine clinics. However methods of treating muscle injuries are variable and re-injury rates tend to be high. This proposal couples novel biocomputational tools and imaging techniques to establish a scientific basis for preventing and rehabilitating hamstring muscle injuries.      ","297204",

Globally 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS the vast majority in sub-Saharan Africa. A prerequisite for the development and implementation of prevention interventions is an understanding of who is at risk and why. Many characteristics of the individual the community they are from and the infection itself contribute to determining the risk of exposure and acquisition and multiple causal pathways exist linking social demographic economic cultural and behavioural variables. Whilst many advances have been made in understanding the spread of HIV from studies of individual risk factors in a diverse range of populations much is still unknown about why populations have experienced different epidemics and what the drivers of high risk are compared with variables that simply correlate with risk. The project will use a multi-level framework to better understand the causal pathways of HIV infection (both in terms of acquisition and transmission of infection) in a rural South African setting where population-based surveys have measured HIV prevalence at >50% in some age-groups. The research aims to identify and quantify important environmental community household and individual-level determinants of HIV incidence and prevalence to inform intervention strategies. Particular emphasis is placed at the level of the local community which is seen as being vital both to understanding the spread of the epidemic and to effective prevention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To be able to implement effective interventions a greater understanding of the complex multi-level nature of the HIV epidemic is necessary. The proposed research will lead to a greater understanding of causal pathways of HIV infection by identifying and quantifying important environmental community household and individual-level determinants of HIV infection. This information can be used to guide effective prevention efforts.        ","232885",

Researchers have identified and engineered a variety of GFP-related proteins including red FPs such as DsRed but many of these new FPs give weaker fluorescence signals than GFP. Moreover monomeric FPs often show a residual self- association that results in mislocalization and even toxicity of fluorescent fusion proteins. Until these problems are remedied the new FPs will never be as broadly useful as GFP. The improvement of FPs will be aided by investigating the mechanisms of chromophore formation.     Our goal is to devise robust directed evolution strategies for enhancing the brightness and minimizing the self-association of DsRed and other FPs. In parallel structure-function analysis of wild-type and mutant FPs will help us to understand key properties such as the pathway of chromophore maturation.     This project is a collaboration between two groups with complementary expertise. One PI (Glick) has extensively engineered DsRed and has created rapidly maturing tetrameric and monomeric variants known commercially as ""DsRed-Express"" and ""DsRed-Monomer"" respectively. The other PI (Keenan) is a skilled structural biologist and an expert at improving proteins by directed evolution. This proposal has three Specific Aims.     Specific Aim #1: To develop assays and procedures for generating brighter FPs that are less prone to self-association. We will use homology- and structure-guided mutagenesis to enhance the fluorescence signals from monomeric FPs and to reduce the tendency of monomeric FPs to self-associate in vivo when present at high local protein concentrations.     Specific Aim #2: To devise a systematic assay system for testing whether a monomeric FP is a suitable fusion tag. We will fuse a monomeric FP to a set of 96 potentially aggregation- sensitive partner proteins in yeast. The resulting in vivo fluorescence patterns will be subjected to detailed image analysis.     Specific Aim #3: To characterize the chromophore maturation pathway and other properties of DsRed. The reactions that generate the DsRed chromophore are incompletely understood. We will test a novel maturation scheme that can explain previously puzzling results.    Fluorescent proteins have become key experimental tools for basic and applied biomedical research. The studies described here will expand the applications of this technology.      ","237636",

It has been reported that the DMA target recognition in vivo sometimes differs from the in vitro-based models.  Understanding the mechanisms that govern the specific DMA recognition in a cellular environment will profoundly augment our understanding of the mechanisms of transcription factor function and will also have a major impact in biomedical research. Furthermore it becomes apparent that new motif finding algorithms need to be developed that specifically for high-throughput protein-DNA in vivo interaction data.    The immediate goal of the proposed work is to develop the methodologies and tools to efficiently analyze high-throughput in vivo protein-DNA association data (like ChIP on chip) and identify the biologically important cis-regulatory elements. The more distant goal is to understand the rules that govern the interactions of transcription factors with their genomic DMA targets. The proposed activity aims initially to develop such a new motif finding software by expanding and testing various methods and strategies. Tests will be based on artificial and ""real"" data and the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods will be assessed. The best performing methods will be used to analyze existing and new ChIP on chip data and predict the cis-regulatory motifs which they will be subsequently confirmed with biochemical methods. Example transcription factors will be used to study the effect of particular cis-regulatory modules on gene expression with a goal of developing the methodology that will allow for complete computational models of gene regulation to be built. Finally a database and web-interface will be developed on and around the tools and the data we will produce that ill allow for efficient data dissemination analysis and mining.    To accomplish these goals a combination of biochemical experimentation and computational algorithmic development is needed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments will be coupled with promoter microarray hybridization (ChlP-on-chip) to identify possible targets for TGFbetal-induced transcription factors in primary lung cells. The data will be analyzed statistically to infer the appropriate quantitative models of the transcription factor binding. Publicly available and newly generated gene expression data will also be analyzed statistically to assess the effect of certain cis-regulatory modules in the expression of the downstream genes.      ","449157",

Two of these diseases targets of investigation by this grant application are stroke and metastatic cancer. Evidence has shown that members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases of which 26 are known play key roles in these processes. In particular there is clear indication that gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) are major contributors. Broad-spectrum synthetic MMP inhibitors were shown to be effective anti-cancer agents in animal models of cancer but produced serious side effects in clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. Broad inhibitory properties of these inhibitors against all MMPs and several related metalloproteinases have been postulated as one of the major reasons for the difficulties and the undesired side effects. We have answered this challenge and have devised the first mechanism-based (suicide) inhibitor (inhibitor 1) that is highly selective for gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) as evidenced by in vitro investigations with purified enzymes. Inhibitor 1 is also active in rodent models for two distinct cancers and stroke. Despite the early promise of inhibitor 1 the molecule is not poised to move forward as it is poorly water soluble and it is readily metabolized. The science disclosed herein is intended to devise the next generation of this type of inhibitor with attention to improved selectivity in targeting better aqueous solubility desirable pharmacokinetic properties and lead optimization which would move the project in the direction of preclinical development and subsequent entry into clinical trials. The clinical needs for intervention of stroke and of aggressive metastatic cancers are genuine. The science disclosed herein holds promise in meeting the clinical challenges.     When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis) it becomes a fatal disease. Similarly stroke is a big killer in the community. Spread of cancer and brain damage after stroke share a number of characteristics that are the subjects of this grant application. The grant applicants have developed a class of molecules that prevent cancer from spreading and prevent brain cell death due to stroke. The present grant application attempts to bring forward members of this type of drug forward for preclinical development.      ","372202",

Relatively little is known about the variables that facilitate optimal social-emotional and adaptive functioning for these young children in real-world environments. The objectives and design of our proposed study take transactional/ecological theoretic approach of child development which purports that development in young children is influenced by many interrelated factors including biological social and cultural. Based on this theoretical framework we propose that the developmental trajectories for young children with mild to severe hearing loss are best understood within a complex context that includes child variables family/parent characteristics and intervention services available to the child and family. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to determine the developmental trajectories of young children with mild to severe hearing loss with respect to social-emotional and adaptive functioning and to compare these developmental patterns to those of young children with typical hearing; 2) to examine the relations between language skills and social-emotional and adaptive development in young children with mild to severe hearing loss; and 3) to examine the influence of parenting and intervention factors on language development and social-emotional and adaptive functioning in young children with mild to severe hearing loss. To accomplish these aims we propose a longitudinal multicenter study of 210 children diagnosed with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss and a group of 100 typical hearing children for comparison purposes. The children will be followed from 12 to 48 months of age and assessed under the outcome domains of audition speech perception language cognition social- emotional problems and competencies and adaptive functioning. Parents will be assessed in terms of their involvement and self-efficacy emotional availability and language input. Lastly specifics of intervention services are considered to be important variables and will be delineated throughout the investigation. Multi-Level Modeling will be implemented as part of the analytic plan permitting descriptions of trajectories for social-emotional and adaptive functioning as well as testing specific hypotheses regarding associations with related child family and intervention service characteristics. This project brings together developmental perspectives from multiple disciplines including audiology speech-language pathology developmental and clinical psychology early intervention pediatrics otolaryngology and biostatistics. The knowledge gained from this longitudinal investigation will inform developmental theory and should promote effective and responsive child and parent support interventions for young children with mild-to-severe hearing loss.         ","777008",

The requisite clinical studiesneeded to provide optimal intervention to this subgroup of children with hearing loss have not been conducted.The proposed research will address this gap. Specifically there is a critical need to examine outcomes in alarge group of children who have benefited from these advances. Thus the overall goal of the proposedstudies is to examine a range of longitudinal outcomes of this subgroup of children with hearing loss. Multi-center multi-disciplinary evaluations will be conducted in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of theimpact of mild to severe hearing loss on these children and their families. It is critical to determine theconstellation of factors that support the early development of speech language cognitive and psychosocialskills as well as quality of life issues within the family. A comprehensive set of child outcomes (e.g. speechproduction and perception language academic psychosocial cognitive) and family outcomes (e.g. parentingquality of life and satisfaction with services) will be examined and compared to results from normal-hearingchildren with similar backgrounds. One of the largest known contributors to outcomes in children with hearingloss is reduced auditory/linguistic experience. Therefore the focus of the proposed work will be on variationsin receipt and effectiveness of early interventions (e.g. hearing aid use educational programs) that areintended to enhance auditory/linguistic experiences. In so doing we believe that it is also important to identifybarriers to service access and other factors that influence intervention compliance. Educational serviceprovision for children with mild to severe hearing loss may vary in critical ways (e.g. accessibility intensity andprovider specialization). Further it is likely that family (community of residence parenting income) and child(temperament communication skills degree of hearing loss) factors will interact with intervention features toinfluence outcomes. The planned recruitment of a large representative sample will support the use ofmultivariate procedures including Structural Equation Modeling to examine the ways in which childhome/community and intervention characteristics combine to affect outcomes. Moderators and Functional Outcomes in Children with Mild to Severe Hearing Loss NarrativeThis project will obtain critical information regarding the extent to which mild to severe hearing loss in earlychildhood threatens the well-being of children. The project also will provide important insight into theeffectiveness of interventions concerned with mitigating the hearing loss and its negative consequences.These data will therefore form the foundation for evidenced based practice and policy for the clinicalmanagement of children with hearing loss.","1573824",

In most cases cancer cells initially spread through regional lymph nodes. Therefore clinical evaluation for the presence of regional lymph node metastases is of paramount importance. Unfortunately there are no real-time non-invasive clinical methods that can reliably detect and diagnose micrometastases in lymph node. Therefore there is an urgent clinical need for an imaging technique that is widely available is non-invasive and simple to perform is safe and can reliably detect and adequately diagnose lymph node micrometastases in real time. The overall goal of our research program is to develop an advanced in-vivo noninvasive molecular specific imaging technology i.e. integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging combined with targeted plasmonic nanosensors capable of immediate and accurate assessment of sentinel lymph node micrometastases in real time. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that photoacoustic imaging integrated with widely used clinical ultrasound imaging is possible and both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging can be performed in real time yielding an immediate diagnosis and allowing early implementation of treatment. A wide range of scientific and engineering biomedical and clinical problems must be addressed to fully explore the capabilities of molecular specific ultrasound and photoacoustic lymphatic (MS-USPAL) imaging in detection and characterization of sentinel lymph node micrometastases. The central theme of the current application is threefold: to design and build a laboratory prototype of the integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system to develop lymphatic contrast agent based on gold bioconjugated plasmonic nanosensors and to initially test the develop imaging technology in 3D tissue phantoms small animal model and finally excised cancerous tissue samples. Therefore all theoretical and experimental studies will be conducted to evaluate applicability of the developed MS-USPAL imaging system for sentinel lymph node micrometastases. At the end of the study we will outline the design and technical specifications of a clinical MS-USPAL imaging system.      ","323672",

In the LGN further segregations of anatomically and physiologically distinct visual pathways have been identified and extensively characterized. Likewise studies in a variety of species have noted the existence of multiple pathways from the SC to the thalamus although these pathways are largely uncharacterized and their functions remain unknown. The tree shrew with its expanded tectopulvinar system is an ideal species to begin to understand how pathways from the SC influence cortical activity via their projections to the pulvinar nucleus. Previous studies characterized two distinct zones in the tree shrew pulvinar nucleus a dorsal region (Pd) which receives diffuse convergent input from the SC and projects to the posterior temporal cortex (Tp) and a central region (Pc) which receives specific topographic projections from the SC and projects to the dorsal temporal cortex (Td). We propose to test the idea that separate tectopulvino- cortical pathways are organized to code distinct features of visual movement. To examine this hypothesis we will 1) use in vivo extracellular recordings to compare the activity of Pd and Pc neurons during the presentation a variety of computer generated stimuli designed to test responses to simple and complex visual motion 2) use in vitro whole cell recordings to compare the membrane properties of Pc and Pc neurons and their responses to stimulation of the SC 3) use tract tracing immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy to anatomically characterize the connections between the Pd and Pc and temporal cortex and 4) use in vivo intrinsic optical imaging to examine temporal cortex response pattern changes following deactivation of the SC Pd or Pc. Given the similarities between the tree shrew and primate visual pathways the results should further our understanding of human motion processing particularly within the tectopulvinar pathway and cortical area MT. Therefore the proposed studies should provide information relevant to the treatment of disorders of motion processing such as dyslexia schizophrenia autism and Williams Syndrome. The proposed studies may also provide insight into ""blindsight"" the ability of some patients to detect visual motion in the absence of visual perception.       ","301230",

The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET mediate the protective effects of stearic acid on gestational diabetes and on the acquired diabetes of the progeny. Rationale. The goal of this proposal is to test the novel hypothesis that stearic acid ameliorates gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and subsequent diabetes in the progeny of GDM mothers through a triad of CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET proteins. We will use the CSTBLKS/J-Lep/*'* mouse that develops GDM around day 16 of gestation. We will examine the mechanisms of stearic acid on CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET expression and function in both GDM and on long-term metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in the progeny of the db/+ dams. Finally we will use individual genetic knockout models for each protein to determine the extent to which each protein mediates the action of stearic acid in both GDM and diabetes of the progeny. The uniqueness and potential clinical relevance of this approach is the mechanistic analysis of a possible means for treatment of both GDM and pursuant diabetes mellitus acquired by the offspring. We propose in vivo studies that can be further dissected by in vitro studies with isolated tissues and cells which will enable us to thoroughly explore the protective mechanism of action of stearic acid. 1. To determine the impact of stearic acid on the development and extent of GDM. Db/+ dams will be used to examine whether stearic acid affects the development of GDM by measuring oral glucose tolerance vascular responsiveness and adipocyte function. The expression and subcellular localization of CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET in adipose will be quantified and functionality of the proteins assessed through measurements of fatty acid biochemistry (p-oxidation fatty acid composition and angiotensin II secretion). Similarly we will also examine the effect of stearic acid treatment fed exclusively to the db/+ dams on the extent of diabetes in the offspring. Finally we will thoroughly examine the mechanism of action of stearic acid on fatty acid biochemistry in insulin resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This aim is important because we will mechanistically evaluate a potential palliative intervention for both GDM and the accompanying diabetes of the offspring. 2. To determine the duration which stearic acid improves the diabetic phenotype in db/db mice. Db/db progeny will be treated with stearic acid and the duration and extent of the protective effect investigated. The effect of withdrawal of stearic acid on the lasting benefit of the intervention will also be examined. We will measure blood pressure vascular responsiveness weight and glucose. We will examine the mechanisms of stearic acid action by determining the expression and subcellular location of CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET in adipose and assessing function of each protein through measurements of adipose fatty acid biochemistry. This aim is important because it will provide data on the cardiovascular benefit and sustainability of stearic acid intervention. 3. To determine whether the beneficial effects of stearic acid are mediated by CD36 ABCD2 and/or mitoNEET. We will cross mice null for CD36 ABCD2 or mitoNEET with db/+ mice and assess the efficacious effects of stearic acid in ameliorating GDM and the ensuing diabetic phenotype of the double crossed db/db progeny lacking each individual gene. We will measure OGTT vascular responsiveness and adipose fatty acid biochemistry in db/+ dams. Furthermore we will assess the effect of individual gene knockout on the ability of stearic acid to affect the development of diabetes in the db/db mice. This will be accomplished through measurements of weight glucose insulin blood pressure and vascular responsiveness. Mechanistically the effects of gene ablation will be dissected through comprehensive analyses of isolated primary adipose biochemistry. This aim is critical because each double crossed mouse line will provide the definitive mechanistic data regarding the role of each protein in mediating the beneficial effects of stearic acid.       ","285783",

The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine the extent to which maternal propensity to obesity or actual obesity predisposes offspring to disorders of glucose regulation and weight homeostasis in this species. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1. To establish and characterize four study populations of pregnant females that a. are made obese prior to pregnancy through exposures to a proven obesity-inducing high-fat diet; b. have a propensity to DIO but are maintained on the typical low fat diet during pregnancy; c. are spontaneously obese; or d. remain lean while exposed to a high fat diet. These four populations will be characterized relative to glucose metabolism and regulation including baseline insulin and HbA1C glucose and response to an oral glucose tolerance test; food intake and physiological and behavioral responses to food; and body composition and circulating concentrations of leptin. 2. To characterize these study populations relative to the following variables during pregnancy and at birth: maternal glucose metabolism and regulation; maternal body composition and circulating concentrations of CRH leptin and estradiol; placental and fetal growth and development including placental function assessed through stereology and estimates of placental CRH leptin and IGF production; endocrine markers of placental size and function; and infant birth weight and and circulating insulin concentration. 3. To characterize changes in body composition feeding and metabolism from post-weaning infancy (6 months) to adulthood (24 months of age) in offspring of these pregnancies by: tracking growth trajectories while fed control or obesity-inducing diets; tracking development of feeding behaviors in weanling infants; determining response to food cues in adults; and tracking glucose metabolism and regulation. The primary null predictions are that obese females regardless of the source of obesity will display a ""pre-diabetic/mild diabetic"" profile resulting in fetal macrosomia and hyperinsulinemia that the DIO propensity group may differ from the diet resistant lean group in terms of metabolic parameters; and that adult offspring will mirror their dam in terms of body composition feeding behavior and glucose metabolism.      ","335598",

Such a vaccine requires (1) a highly accelerated vaccine schedule and (2) the rapid induction of antiviral immunity in local tissues of the oral and intestinal mucosa and their draining lymph nodes. We hypothesize that live attenuated immunogens are optimal candidates because (i) they can induce innate and adaptive immune responses against a spectrum of antigens (ii) continue to boost these responses and thus (iii) would effectively stimulate the developing infant immune system. However for obvious safety reasons live attenuated HIV vaccination is not feasible. Mycobacterium bovis bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination induces strong T helper 1 (Th1) responses in human infants. Given the large geographical overlap between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV infection in Africa BCG vaccination was formerly recommended for all infants at birth to protect against tuberculosis disease (TB). However immunodeficiency resulting from HIV-1 infection clearly predisposes infants to disseminated BCGosis. A safer TB vaccine is urgently needed. We propose to address both the urgent needs for a pediatric HIV vaccine and for a novel safer TB vaccine by developing a highly attenuated Mtb vaccine vector (AMtb) expressing HIV antigens as a prophylactic neonatal HIV vaccine. This immunogen may protect not only against breast-milk HIV transmission but also against Mtb infection. Both HIV-1 and TB are major causes of infant mortality and morbidity in Africa and the successful development of a combination vaccine effective against both infections would be a major advance in the global war against pediatric diseases in developing countries. We hypothesize that highly attenuated Mtb mc25226 or its derivatives expressing HIV antigens (rAMtb-HIV) can be safely administered orally at birth will elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses and thus engender protection against oral HIV infection. We will test hypothesis in the rhesus macaque model of infant oral SIV infection. AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that oral administration of mc25226- SIVgag is safe and superior to parental vaccination in eliciting local mucosal immune responses in newborn macaques. In AIM 2 we will develop strategies to optimize the immunogenicity of rAMtb in newborn macaques through genetic manipulations of immune response genes in Mtb and define the underlying immune mechanisms by which mc25226-SIVgag enhances mucosal and systemic immune responses and how mucosal adjuvants and various prime-boost strategies influence dendritic cell activation CD4+T cell priming and enhance SIV-specific CD8+T and B cell responses in infant macaques. The efficacy of a rAMtb-SIV vaccine expressing multiple SIV antigens (Gag Pol and Env) against oral SIV challenge in infant macaques will be tested in AIM 3. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a novel oral pediatric combination vaccine that can potentially protect infants at birth against HIV infection via breast-milk transmission and against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection two diseases with major impact on infant mortality and morbidity especially in developing countries.      ","687840",

The pandemic primarily affects those in peak years of childbearing who may not be aware of their HIV status or use condoms. Intentional childbearing may place heterosexual couples at risk of HIV infection in resource-limited settings with high HIV prevalence areas where society places great value on having children. We propose a community-based prospective cohort study that will offer home-based HIV counseling and testing to heterosexually active couples and obtain reproductive and sexual health data and pregnancy and HIV incidence from men and women in Nyando district western Kenya. A randomly-selected cohort of HIV discordant (n?960) concordant-negative (subset of n?960) and concordant-positive (n?480) couples will be followed. Aim 1. Determine and compare HIV incidence among HIV-discordant couples who intend pregnancy versus those who do not intend to become pregnant using rapid HIV assays every 6 months for 2 years. Aim 2. Describe and compare sexual behaviors contraception condom use couple-level behaviors and factors and sociocultural norms in the cohort using rapid urine pregnancy tests and audio computer-assisted self interviews from each member of the dyad every 6 months for 2 years. Aim 3. Develop a theoretical sociobehavioral model of how reproductive decision-making processes influence the risk of HIV transmission. This model will be developed using Aims 1 and 2 data as well as qualitative data collected via dyad interviews (n=30) and 12 focus group discussions (among HIV-negative males HIV-negative females HIV-positive males HIV-positive females) conducted at baseline and at month 18. We will apply the theoretical model elements to the cohort data using structural equation modeling to assess its value in predicting incident HIV and pregnancy. A policy meeting will be held in Kenya to discuss study findings. This study will contribute significantly to design of interventions to reduce horizontal and vertical HIV transmission in resource-limited settings.        ","428700",

In light of treatment advances that have significantly prolonged survival improved perinatal prophylaxis as well as increased access to assisted reproductive techniques [ART] that can reduce the risks of horizontal transmission many of these individuals desire to have a child. Nevertheless to date there is still a paucity of research on HIV-infected men's fertility- related desires and behavior especially in the US. Individuals in a serodiscordant relationship who attempt natural conception confront the risks of both horizontal and vertical transmission. Available data on heterosexual serodiscordant couples suggest that a substantial proportion of them engage in unprotected sex in their usual sexual behavior. Further the availability of more effective treatments for HIV disease may have led to a greater willingness among these couples to assume the risks of unprotected sex. Although reproductive dilemmas are a key emotional issue facing serodiscordant couples very little is known about how these couples think negotiate and communicate about their desires for having or not a child using or not contraception and how their sexual behavior may differ in the context of contemplating pregnancy or attempting conception or desiring to avoid conception. To investigate these issues we propose a qualitative study of 100 serodiscordant heterosexual couples (50 with a HIV+ male partner and 50 with an HIV+ female). The specific aims are:     1. To investigate each partner's desire motives and deterrents for having a child within a serodiscordant couple.     2. To investigate each partner's perceptions of the risks of horizontal and vertical transmission in the context of conception and their knowledge and beliefs regarding opportunities for managing these transmission risks.     3. To investigate each partner's willingness to engage in unprotected sex and tolerate the risks of transmission and pregnancy and also the strategies used to manage these risks and the reasons for using them.     4. To investigate how partners in serodiscordant relationships negotiate and communicate about pregnancy contraception and HIV risk.     5. To investigate each partner's perceptions and experiences of support or discouragement of their reproductive goals from health care providers and family.         ","588024",

Similarly anti-tumor immunity may be directed against antigens which are non-mutated self proteins or which incorporate tumor-associated mutations into the recognized epitope. Until recently structural studies of TCR/peptide/MHC complexes had been limited to anti- foreign TCRs. In 2005 however we reported the structure of an autoimmune TCR bound to a self- peptide from myelin basic protein (MBP) and HLA-DR2a. Subsequently we determined the trimolecular structure of a human melanoma-specific TCR recognizing a naturally-occurring somatic mutation in the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (mutTPI) in the context of HLA-DR1. Remarkably these structures revealed unconventional binding topologies that appear suboptimal for TCR binding and that may reflect the distinct selection pressures exerted on autoreactive as compared to anti-foreign TCRs. These results open the way to a systematic investigation of the structural and biophysical principles governing self-recognition in autoimmunity and cancer and to using this knowledge to engineer agents to specifically modulate (suppress or enhance) T cell responses to self-antigens. Our objectives are: 1. Basis for TCR recognition of self-antigens. We will extend our previous work to determine whether DR4-restricted TCRs from MS and T1D patients also bind self-peptide/MHC with altered topologies and suboptimal interactions. 2. Basis for TCR recognition of tumor antigens. To compare recognition of non- mutated versus mutant tumor antigens and interpret this in the context of self-antigen recognition in autoimmune diseases we will examine TCR recognition of the non-mutated HLA-DR4-restricted melanoma antigens tyrosinase (Ty) and gp100. 3. High-affinity TCRs as potential immunotherapeutics for MS. Directed evolution (yeast display) will be used to engineer high-affinity MBP-specific TCRs as novel agents for targeting immunosuppressive cytokines to sites of autoantigen presentation. 4. Altered peptide ligands for enhancing anti-melanoma T cell responses. Based on binding and structural information on TCR recognition of Ty and gp100 these shared melanoma epitopes will be modified for heightened immunogenicity. 5. Ligand-induced TCR dimerization as a possible T cell signaling mechanism. As demonstrated in solution the melanoma-specific TCR G4 dimerizes upon binding mutTPI/DR1. To test the hypothesis that the (G4/mutTPI/DR1)2 complex represents a basic T cell signaling unit we will determine its structure and assess the structure through mutagenesis and correlative functional analyses of T cell activation. Taken together these studies will provide a comprehensive view of the biophysical basis for anti-self immunity in autoimmune diseases and cancer. Public Health Relevance Statement: While remarkable progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis for TCR recognition of microbial antigens much less is known about the principles governing TCR recognition of self or altered self in autoimmune diseases and cancer. Our objective is to elucidate these principles through structural biophysical and correlative functional analyses of autoimmune and tumor-specific TCRs and to use this knowledge to engineer agents to specifically suppress or enhance T cell responses to self.      ","405000",

In addition TRAIL receptor signaling determines the efficiency with which other agents kill tumor cells. However tumor cells are often resistant to TRAIL and the mechanisms by which this occurs and what this resistance means for tumor progression and clinical outcomes is poorly understood. We recently discovered that one mechanism by which breast and ovarian tumor cells can become selectively resistant to TRAIL is through the increased expression of the homeobox transcription factor Six1. We found that increased Six1 is common occurring in >60% of metastatic ovarian cancers and 90% of metastatic breast cancers and associated with poor clinical outcomes. We further found that Six1 expression is sufficient to make non-metastatic tumor cells metastasize in vivo. Because TRAIL signaling is known to suppress metastasis we hypothesize that Six1 inhibits TRAIL by a specific mechanism and this leads to increased metastasis resulting in poor clinical outcomes in patients and resistance of patient's tumors to TRAIL. To test this hypothesis we propose an integrated project that will determine the molecular mechanism by which Six1 inhibits TRAIL receptor-induced apoptosis test if these mechanisms are responsible for increased metastasis in mice and determine whether these effects apply in primary tumor cells from patients and if they lead to worse clinical outcomes. Because this work encompasses research on basic mechanisms at the cellular level testing those mechanisms in animal models of cancer progression and metastasis and clinical and translational studies in ovarian and breast cancer patients' tumors we have adopted a team approach that will involve a cell biologist with expertise in TRAIL signaling (Dr. Thorburn) a pioneer in the analysis of Six1 in cancer development and progression (Dr. Ford) and an oncologist with expertise in clinical and translational research (Dr. Behbakht). To achieve these goals we have the following aims: 1. Determine how Six1 alters signaling by TRAIL receptor-targeted therapeutic agonists in ovarian and breast cancer. 2. Test if Six1-induced metastasis involves the TRAIL resistance mechanism and 3. Determine if Six1 expression predicts TRAIL sensitivity and prognosis in patient tumors. Together these aims should allow us to understand how Six1 regulates TRAIL receptor signaling determine the role of these mechanisms in tumor metastasis and test if the same mechanisms apply in breast and ovarian cancer patients and thus determines their clinical outcomes.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Breast and ovarian cancer are the second and fifth leading causes of cancer death in women. One exciting new approach to treating these (and other) cancers is to use therapies that directly activate TRAIL receptors however many tumor cells are resistant to these therapies. This project focuses on one mechanism (Six1 expression) by which tumor cells become resistant to TRAIL that our data indicate affect a high proportion of metastatic cancer patients (~60-90%). By understanding how this mechanism causes resistance to TRAIL how this affects disease progression and metastasis and how this alters clinical outcomes in patients we should gain new insights into the value of Six1 as a prognostic marker and better understand how to use the TRAIL therapeutics that are being developed.      ","409028",

It is generally understood that biological functions and biological activities are controlled by subsets of genes interacting with proteins in a highly controlled manner. High throughput technologies such as microarrays are valuable for studying a large number of biological components simultaneously but sound conclusions from these technologies depend on appropriate statistical analyses of the genomic/proteomic data. The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop appropriate statistical tools to explore gene/protein interactions and to discover how these interactions function in biological activities (e.g. induction of disease phenotype). This proposal concerns the analysis of short oligonucleotide data as in GeneChip studies and exon tiling arrays. Low-rank approximations to the expression data matrices play a central role in the proposed research. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a fast and robust low-rank algorithm to perform low-rank approximation to a data matrix that is subject to outliers; (2) to develop diagnostic tools and statistical tests for determining whether a low-rank representation is adequate to capture gene expression profiles; (3) to develop both nonparametric and likelihood-based approaches for flagging and detecting alternative splicing with exon tiling arrays. Singular value decomposition is a starting point for the proposed work towards those specific aims. Alternating robust (outlier resistant) regression methods will be used for Aims (1) and (3). Likelihood- based and data adaptive methods will be developed for Aims (2) and (3). The proposed research distinguishes itself from most of the existing statistical work on microarray data as it focuses on probe-level rather than gene-level data. The investigators believe that the standard uni-dimensional summary of gene expression data could lead to loss of important information. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical tools for analyzing microarray data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research as evidenced by the recent discovery of target genes for cervical cancer and prostate cancer. Those tools are needed to support better applications of microarray technology in clinical and biomedical research.        ","221515",

Recently a hypoventilation training has been recommended that claims improvements in asthma control by raising basal pCO2 levels. Physiological research supports the rationale of the technique and a number of controlled trials have demonstrated limited benefits of the training. However because none of these studies has provided evidence for increases in basal pCO2 levels across training the central assumption of the hypoventilation training idea remains untested. Based on this rationale and the evidence from respiratory physiology we recently developed and pilot-tested a home-based pCO2 biofeedback assisted BT with a handheld capnometry device for asthma patients. The primary goal of this training was to teach patients how to increase their basal pCO2 levels. The results showed that this procedure was successful in relieving symptoms improving control of asthma and reducing diurnal variability of lung function an objective indicator of asthma severity. We are proposing a 4-year study to systematically assess the efficacy of hypoventilation-based BT as an adjunct treatment for asthma. The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the short- and long-term benefits of 5 sessions of hypoventilation training compared to a control intervention of breathing regularity and awareness training. We will randomize a total of 120 asthma patients. The outcome will be evaluated by a multi-level standard measures test battery of asthma control including measures of pathophysiology (peak flow variability airway inflammation by exhaled nitric oxide airway hyperreactivity to methacholine basal lung function) self- reported asthma control and symptoms and self-medication behavior (bronchodilator use). Effects on asthma management (corticoid inhaler adherence perceived control and efficacy of management perceived triggers) general well-being (perceived health stress anxiety depression) and cardio-respiratory function in daily life (multi-system ambulatory respiratory inductance plethysmography capnometry spiromtery) will also be assessed. We expect substantial benefits of the capnometry-assisted breathing training on asthma control We will also explore the role of improvements in asthma management and general well- being (perceived health stress anxious and depressed mood) through training as a mediators of change in asthma control as well as the potential of exhaled nitric oxide to predict clinically significant change in other asthma control measures throughout therapy. This study will explore the benefits of a novel breathing training for asthma patients added to their regular medication treatment. The trainings aims at reducing hyperventilation which is known to make asthma worse but which has not been targeted successfully by prior breathing training methods. We expect our training to improve asthma control reduce symptoms and medication needs as well as improve patients' well-being.    Public Health Relevance Paragraph: Research suggests that asthma patients may often hyperventilate which makes their symptoms worse. In this project we will test a breathing training that reduces hyperventilation with the help of a hand-held device that helps patients monitor their breathing. Patients will participate in a four-week intervention with five training sessions and breathing home exercises which is expected to improve their asthma control and well-being.      ","405897",

The complex loading is due to its anatomical structure with non-uniaxial forces generated by the surrounding soft tissues the coracoacromial arch oblique insertion angles and non-uniform fiber orientations. In order to understand predict prevent and treat supraspinatus degeneration and injury as well as to design tissue engineered replacement structures it is critical to develop a complete understanding of the mechanical capability of this tissue in normal and altered conditions. Therefore the objective of this research program is to rigorously evaluate anisotropic and nonlinear structure-function relationships in normal and degenerate supraspinatus tendons. Specifically we propose the following 2 aims: Aim 1: Quantify nonlinear and anisotropic mechanical behavior and collagen fiber re-orientation of normal and degenerated human supraspinatus tendon under multiple loading modalities including: uniaxial tension in the fiber-aligned and transverse directions biaxial tension and planar shear. Quantify biochemical composition and histological grade at adjacent locations to the mechanical test samples. Aim 2: Develop and apply a nonlinear anisotropic constitutive model to predict tendon structure-function relationships. Explicitly incorporate fiber distribution and fiber re-orientation under load and the contribution of fiber stretch extrafibrillar matrix and fiber-matrix interactions to tendon function. Determine the model parameters using the biaxial and shear experimental data from Aim 1 and validate the model by predicting the uniaxial tension data. Correlate model parameters with composition measurements to complete the structure-composition-function quantification and test hypotheses for these relationships with region and degeneration. Knowledge of these relationships will provide important information towards understanding the fundamental mechanisms driving normal tissue adaptation and aging disease processes and potential treatments and the design of tissue engineered replacement structures.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rotator cuff damage due to degeneration and/or injury is a common cause of significant pain and disability affecting the young and old alike in workplace recreational athletic and aging environments. Treatment strategies aim to restore mechanical function; however tendon anisotropic and nonlinear mechanical behaviors are not well established. Therefore the objective of this research program is to determine quantitative anisotropic and nonlinear structure-function relationships in normal and degenerate supraspinatus tendons.      ","305780",

These agents contain two ligands that direct the construct to crosslink two different cell surface receptors resulting in dramatic increases in binding selectivity. This has advantages over agents directed against single receptors in that they do not rely on overexpression of a single cell surface protein. The proposed constructs also have advantages over other multifunctional agents in that they are produced via convergent synthesis and are designed to be relatively small with favorable ADME characteristics. Work during the first period of support has (1) identified and validated a receptor combination that can be used to target a subset of metastatic melanomas and (2) demonstrated a proof-of-principle that synthetic heterobivalent agents can crosslink heterologous receptors. These constructs bound with up to 50-fold higher affinity compared to corresponding monovalent interactions. Current research will combine these two advances to develop heterobivalent agents against an identified target receptor pair. To achieve this goal Aim 1 will use a previously developed G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) system to derive analytical solutions that predict behavior of multivalent ligands as imaging agents. Aim 2 will develop bivalent agents that target a receptor combination identified in the first period of support: N-formyl peptide receptor like type 2 (FPRL2) and the type 1 melanocortin receptor (MC1R). In this aim optimum linker and ligand chemistries will be determined with high-throughput binding assays. Bivalent ligands will be labeled with fluorophores for testing by in-cyto and in-vivo imaging. Those with optimum characteristics will be labeled with DOTA. DOTA derivatives will be used to chelate Eu for ex vivo fluorescence and 111In for in vivo SPECT assessment of pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Aim 3 will continue the validation effort for 21 additional receptors that were identified as targets during the first period of support. These will be validated primarily though immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays containing multiple melanoma grades as well as multiple normal tissues. It is expected that this work will result in the validation of additional receptor combinations that will target a majority of metastatic melanomas. At the end of this next period of support we will have (1) developed more precise analytical methods to predict the behavior of multivalent ligands as imaging agents; (2) developed targeting ligands that will be useful against 40-50% of metastatic melanomas and (3) identified additional 3- and 4-receptor target combinations for the remaining molecular phenotypes of this disease.The goal of the proposed work is to develop platform targeting agents for delivery of imaging and therapy to metastatic melanoma. These agents are heterobivalent in that they link together two ligands that are directed against two different cell surface receptors. Such agents have advantages over agents directed against single epitopes by not relying on a single overexpressed cell surface protein. They also have advantages over other multifunctional agents in that they are produced via convergent synthesis and hence are relatively small with acceptable ADME characteristics.      ","636070",

Our overall goal is to apply cutting edge imaging technologies for the living cell to elucidate those aspects of virus infectivity that depend crucially on dynamic domains in the plasma membrane. In Specific Aim I using molecular biology and lipid manipulation techniques in combination with live cell imaging we will ask what molecular factors promote formation and stabilization of microdomains of influenza hemeagglutinin HA expressed in fibroblasts. This combined approach will provide live cell nanoassays for molecular interactions important in domain assembly and stability. Aim II will focus on the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN (CD209) which is expressed on the surface of Dendritic Cells (DC) where it functions as an antigen capture receptor and cell adhesion molecule. Various microbes including HIV-1 bind to DC-SIGN to gain entry into DC. Previous studies using fixed cells demonstrated that DC-SIGN forms discrete antigen-capture clusters of 100-200 nm diameter on immature DC in the absence of any receptor ligation. We will study DC-SIGN clusters on living cells where detailed analysis of their dynamic properties--when loaded with different cargos--can be pursued. We will test the hypothesis that a key initial step in viral infection involves DC- SIGN clusters that when loaded with pathogen cargo are triggered to undergo directed lateral transport to sites of further processing by the host cell. Aim III will focus on microdomains that contain multiple components including the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein and a class of transmembrane proteins the tetraspanins. We will test the hypothesis that the initial stages of virus assembly require Gag multimers to localize to tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and once there form stable clusters that will become sites of viral budding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The health-related significance of this proposal is based on the fact that effective long-lasting strategies to thwart productive HIV-1 infection have remained elusive. The overwhelming majority of vaccine development has focused on the traditional methods of modifying the virus to elicit an immune response but this has been problematic because HIV-1 maintains one of the highest mutation rates amongst all viruses. As a result increasing efforts have been focused on understanding how the virus interacts with its host cell with the ultimate goal of therapeutically disrupting these interactions. Cellular membrane microdomains are critical to the life of HIV-1 in cells in that the virus relies on their specific spatial arrangements for both entry into and exit out of target cells. Detailed information obtained in this grant on such membrane domains in the host cell will provide a better understanding of certain steps in HIV infection thereby leading to new therapeutic targets.      ","349480",

Mental health conditions cause one in ten children to suffer significant impairment at home at school and in the community. Critical to the Healthy People 2010 objective of reducing the prevalence of mental disorders among young people is a clearer understanding of the developmental processes underlying childhood psychopathology. In children adolescents and adults  comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception.  Yet to date most research on child and adolescent psychopathology has either disregarded the presence of or eliminated participants with co- morbid disorders. Neither approach is useful towards the end of addressing the needs of the majority of persons with mental health conditions who have co-occurring problems. The purpose of the proposed research is to explicate the development and resolution of co-occurring and non-co-occurring depressive and conduct problems by studying adolescents as they move into a period of marked escalation and gender differentiation in risk for major depressive conduct and substance abuse disorders. The proposed research project addresses key questions that have emerged regarding comorbidity by taking advantage of a unique opportunity to assess late adolescent psychopathology and related constructs in a community-based sample that has an overrepresentation of adolescents at risk for comorbid and non- comorbid depressive and conduct problems. The sample includes both girls and boys is racially diverse and was well-characterized using a repeated measurement design with six assessments during the early adolescent years (6th-9th grades). In the proposed study 450 adolescents and a parent/guardian will undergo in- person interviews in the 12th grade. The research addresses the question of whether comorbidity is a developmental phenomenon of early adolescence. To this end both dimensional and categorical approaches will be used to determine the extent to which forms of psychopathology change from non-specific (mixed symptom presentation) to specific (presentation consistent with a specific form of adult psychopathology) over the course of adolescent development. Risk factors that contribute to escalating pathways towards specific and comorbid disorders and protective factors that mitigate early vulnerabilities to psychopathology will be identified. Functional outcomes in the areas of school vocational and social relationships of adolescents with comorbid and non-comorbid depressive and conduct problems will be compared to adolescents with neither form of psychopathology. Gender differentiation in developmental pathways will be explicated. The proposed research addresses a  premier challenge facing mental health professionals  by providing information that will highlight opportunities for intervention to reduce suffering and adverse consequences from comorbid psychiatric conditions that manifest during the adolescent developmental period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although depression and disruptive behavior problems commonly co-occur in children theories as to why they co-occur have not been adequately tested. The Adolescent Comorbidity Study (ACS) will address questions about risk and protective factors outcomes and meaning of co- occurrence between these heterotypic mental health problems in a community-based cohort whose early adolescent status was well-characterized. Results will yield information about etiology and nosology that is critical to the Healthy People 2010 objective of reducing the prevalence of mental disorders among young people.      ","419152",

Recent studies have demonstrated that the CARMA1-Bcl10- MALT1 signaling pathway is essential for TCR mediated NF-?B activation. Consistent with this we have demonstrated that CARMA1 is essential for the development of allergic airway inflammation through its role in T lymphocytes. Furthermore we have shown that CARMA1 dependent signal transmission is regulated by sequential phosphorylation by kinases. However the exact mechanism of CARMA1 regulation in vivo remains elusive. In four interrelated aims we will explore the regulation of CARMA1 in T cells and determine the effect of disruption of CARMA1 expression after the establishment of Th2-type pulmonary inflammation. The experimental design emphasizes the use of in vivo models of pulmonary inflammation as well as conventional approaches based on the analysis of interacting proteins using biochemical and genetic studies. The outcome of these studies will provide insight into NF-?B signaling in health and pulmonary inflammation and may identify novel therapeutic targets. Aim 1: To characterize the role of CARMA1 in T lymphocytes during the development of allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma. Aim 2: To characterize the role of CARMA1 in regulatory T cell (Treg) development and function in a murine model of asthma. Aim 3: To determine the in vivo role of serine phosphorylation of CARMA1 in lymphocyte signaling by transgenic analysis. Aim 4: To delineate novel components of signaling pathways activated by CARMA1 in T lymphocytes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Asthma remains one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. Although effective therapy is achieved by the use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants these drugs suppress a broad spectrum of immune function. In this proposal we investigate a protein involved in the development of asthma in a mouse model of disease. The information obtained from our proposed studies may allow us to develop more specific therapy for this disorder.      ","408550",

Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment cause psychosocial distress disrupted social relationships anxiety poor sleep uncertainty and fear of cancer recurrence. This distress can extend beyond treatment and adversely affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Interventions that stem the tide of negative emotions and their physiological sequelae are needed. Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has established that psychosocial distress impairs immune function. We have shown that women diagnosed with breast cancer have significant psychosocial distress that is accompanied by dysregulated natural killer cell activity (NKCA) and cytokine production. These observations are especially important in that impairment of these forms of immune function is associated with increased tumor initiation primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Metastatic disease is the primary cause of death from breast cancer. Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is a mind-body intervention that shows promise for management of the distress associated with cancer. We show that MBSR reduces neuroendocrine stress activation and improves immune function and quality of life of breast cancer patients during the vulnerable period of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Using a randomized controlled design this study will evaluate the potential benefits of MBSR on psychosocial distress neuroendocrine stress activation immune function and HRQOL. Women with early stage breast cancer will be randomized to an 8-week MBSR intervention or a control condition. Assessments of immune function (NKCA and cytokines) neuroendocrine activity (salivary cortisol and plasma catecholamines) psychosocial response and HRQL will be obtained pre- mid- at completion and post-MBSR. Hypotheses will test whether MBSR can improve the psychosocial response of women to breast cancer diagnosis and treatment reduce neuroendocrine stress activation restore immune function and increase HRQOL. The relationship among main study variables will be explored by mediation model testing. These assessments will be achieved during the critical period of cancer diagnosis and treatment when restoration of immune function is most significant. Understanding the trajectory and the nature of the psycho-endocrine-immune response to a promising mind-body approach like MBSR using a rigorous design in a well-defined cancer population will significantly contribute to the science of PNI and to integrative cancer care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alternative or complementary approaches that enhance the quality of life of women with breast cancer have grown in popularity.

An understanding of GPCR activation structure and regulation will facilitate the design and synthesis of drugs to treat many diseases. Despite intense and sustained efforts by many scientists over the last twenty-five years there remain large gaps in our knowledge of the structure and function of GPCRs. The goals of this proposal are to use the S. cerevisiae pheromone alpha-factor and its GPCR receptor Ste2p to develop approaches that can be used to learn about how activated receptors transmit a signal to intracellular G proteins to acquire information on receptor structure in the resting and ligand-activated state and to learn how GPCR signaling is regulated. Specifically we will conduct experiments to: (i) reveal the conformational changes in extracellular and intracellular domains of Ste2p that are triggered by agonist binding or constitutive mutation and define interactions between receptor and G protein (ii) elucidate the three-dimensional structure of large fragments of GPCRs alone and as part of a reconstituted receptor and (iii) study the regulation of signal transduction by identifying proteins that interact with the carboxyl-terminus of Ste2p and examine the conformational changes in the C-terminus induced by these interactions. To accomplish these goals we will use molecular biological biochemical and biophysical approaches including substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis unnatural amino acid replacement native chemical ligation bioluminescent resonance energy transfer and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Success in these studies should provide an understanding of GPCR structure and molecular mechanisms of activation as well as new experimental tools that can be used by investigators studying this important group of human receptors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Peptide hormones control many essential biological processes in all organisms and tissues. Mutations in genes encoding hormone receptors lead to many pathological conditions in humans and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the target of a majority of pharmacological agents used in medicine today. An understanding of mechanism of action of GPCRs the structure of these integral membrane proteins and how signal transduction is regulated will fill fundamental gaps in our knowledge to facilitate the design and synthesis of drugs to treat many diseases.      ","646970",

We will also perform prospective follow-up of a subset of patients diagnosed with VTE in 2009 and 2011. Despite advances in the diagnosis prophylaxis and treatment of this clinical syndrome which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) VTE remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Based on data from our initial study the rates of recurrence of VTE after an initial diagnosis and the rates of bleeding related to VTE treatment remain unacceptably high. It has been estimated that annual mortality from VTE in Americans exceeds that of AIDS breast cancer and highway fatalities combined. This surveillance project will continue the follow-up of all residents of Worcester MA diagnosed with DVT and/or PE during our 3 previous study years (1999 2001 and 2003) with extension to 4 new study years (2005 2007 2009 and 2011). The overlapping components of this community-based study have been designed to provide complementary and inclusive information about the contemporary epidemiology of VTE including incidence rates outcomes physician management practices and health-related quality of life (QOL) and changes over time therein. Detailed follow-up of our prospective cohorts will allow for more in-depth analysis of the natural history of VTE its impact on health related QOL duration and intensity of anticoagulation therapies employed and evaluation of long-term medical care utilization patterns. The data provided from this study will be instrumental in identifying populations of patients with VTE at high risk for adverse outcomes improper or underutilization of specific diagnostic testing or therapies and contemporary outcomes. This information will set the stage for the design of targeted interventions to address shortcomings in current management practices with the goal of favorably influencing the long-term outcomes of patients with VTE.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been estimated that blood clots of the legs and lungs cause more deaths per year than AIDS breast cancer and highway fatalities combined. Data obtained from this study will allow for better estimates of the true burden of this disease in the U.S. as well as deficiencies in current management practices. This information will set the stage for future studies designed to address these shortcomings.        ","817624",

The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke MI and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid cardiac and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities silent infarcts and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke MI and vascular death) and adiponectin a new marker of obesity new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry) and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke MI death and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community the outstanding follow-up record the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics and $379 billion for blacks.     Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.     The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke MI vascular death and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.        ","1593459",

Previous relapse prevention programs have had disappointing results. The proposed intervention addresses the limitations of previous programs by assessing women on multiple risk dimensions creating a risk profile triaging women to an appropriate level of intervention intensity matching the intervention to women's risks continuing the intervention for 10 months postpartum and referring women to community resources. In this study we will: a) evaluate the efficacy of our intervention to delay or prevent women's return to smoking postpartum b) explore the relative contribution of risk factors (dependence readiness self efficacy sensory aversion stopped for the fetus partner smoking depression and weight concerns) to postpartum smoking c) describe the natural course of change of risk factors d) describe the context in which abstinence or resumption occurs and e) estimate the costs of intervention delivery. A two arm randomized trial will be conducted. The sample will be 450 pregnant women age 18 or older from two North Carolina sites who stopped smoking during pregnancy. Women will be screened abut their risk factors between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy and triaged to one of four levels of stepped care that includes one in person counseling session and at least one telephone session during pregnancy and from 7 12 telephone sessions over 10 months postpartum. Concepts from the self determination theory social cognitive theory transtheoretical model and relapse prevention theory that are relevant for the transition from pregnancy to postpartum will guide the intervention strategies that include motivational interviewing enhancing self efficacy anticipating and planning for high risk parenting and social situations and the use of pharmacotherapies. Women randomized to the control arm will receive a relapse prevention booklet and usual care. Quantitative data on smoking status and risk variables will be collected at baseline 6 weeks and 6 and 12 month postpartum and qualitative data will be collected at 12 months. Survival curve analysis will be used to determine the primary outcome of time to first smoking resumption. An efficacious resumption prevention intervention will move us toward the Healthy People 2010 tobacco goals for women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pregnancy is a time when many women quit smoking; however many return to smoking after the baby is born. Programs developed to prevent this return to smoking have not been very effective. We are proposing to test a program whose intensity is matched to women's characteristics to help delay or prevent return to smoking. Our overall goal is to help women who quit smoking during pregnancy become lifetime nonsmokers.       ","606758",

A strong relationship exists between sand flies and Leishmania such that in nature only certain species of sand flies are able to transmit certain species of Leishmania. Such species-specificity is driven by several molecular factors that allow the parasite to infect survive and multiply within the midgut of the sand fly and be transmitted to a suitable host during a blood meal. Some sand fly species are considered permissive in that they are able to harbor experimental infections of several Leishmania species (e.g. Lutzomyia. longipalpis); other sand fly species are considered restrictive as they can only be infected with the Leishmania species that they carry in nature (e.g. Phlebotomus. papatasi). The precise interactions that lead to this vector competence whether for permissive or restrictive vectors remain to be completely elucidated. We previously defined one specific interaction between L. major lipophosphoglycan and a P. papatasi galectin-like molecule that is essential for vector competence and demonstrated that antibodies targeted to this midgut molecule prevent establishment of Leishmania major within the sand fly midgut. Here we propose a set of studies using this restrictive vector/parasite system to identify additional sand fly molecules that participate in the development of Leishmania within the sand fly midgut. Our studies will specifically focus on the use of RNA interference to assess the roles of proteins such as PpChym2 a blood-induced chymotrypsin that may be involved in early killing of Leishmania; and PpChit1 a midgut-specific chitinase that is thought to play a role in Leishmania escape from the peritrophic matrix. Additionally recently identified midgut transcripts such as those coding for peritrophins and thrombin-specific inhibitors will also be evaluated. Once identified P. papatasi molecules that effectively interfere with the development of L. major also will be tested for their broad spectrum activity in other sand fly vector combinations including P. argentipes and L. donovani. This research will advance the knowledge regarding sand fly-Leishmania interaction and will provide insights for the selection of transmission blocking candidates as a strategy to eliminate and/or reduce leishmaniasis. Project Narrative: Phlebotomine sand flies are the main vectors of leishmaniasis a multi-spectrum disease that causes substantial morbidity and mortality in the developing world. As effective therapies are un-affordable to most patients and no vaccines are available vector-based strategies specifically transmission-blocking vaccines are becoming a choice strategy to control many vector transmitted diseases. Our studies aim at assessing the effect of silencing a selected number of sand fly proteins thought to be involved in Leishmania development within the sand fly; elucidating how these proteins interact with Leishmania parasites undoubtedly will lead to the development of novel strategies to fight parasite transmission.         ","56559",

This disease is caused by B. burgdorferi (Bb) and is the most commonly reported arthropod-borne illness in the US and Europe with the number of reported infections raising each year. The spirochetes cause persistent infections and chronic disease with bouts of arthritis and carditis in untreated patients. Our long-term objective is to delineate the mechanisms with which Bb evades effective immunity during persistent infection of fully immunocompetent hosts. Previous studies have identified antibodies as a main immune mediator of disease resolution (but not clearance of the spirochete) and passive protection. While antibodies in early infection are strongly functional with respect to disease-resolution and passive protective capacity the protective capacity wanes as disease progresses. The objective of this proposal is to assess the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the Bb- specific humoral response to ascertain whether strengthening of humoral responses could be exploited for therapeutic or prophylactic use. Based upon preliminary findings we aim to test the hypothesis that Bb- specific B cells provide antibody responses by short-lived plasma cells at the expense of higher affinity B cells and long-lived plasma cells due to a lack of functional CD4 helper T cell activation. A murine model of Borrelia infection will be used to conduct three Specific Aims. Specific Aim #1 will determine the extent to which the early-induced specific IgM and/or IgG responses actively inhibit protective immunity using genetically altered mice unable to secrete certain Ig isotypes. Specific Aim #2 will test whether Bb drives lymph node B cell responses away from germinal center responses. This could result in the lack of affinity maturation and longevity and could cause a loss of functionality over time as observed in Lyme Borrelioses. Assays will include multicolor flow cytometry to determine the nature and quality of the induced response. Furthermore the responding B cell subsets will be identified and their regulation by CD4 T cells will be assessed. Also the extent to which a lack of affinity maturation and development of long-lived plasma cells underlies the functional defect in the Bb-specific antibody responses will be determined by studying antibodies to decarin-binding protein as a prototype response. Specific Aim #3 will determine whether the lack of long- term functional B cell response induction to Borrelia is due to active inhibition and/or a failure of functional CD4 helper T cell response induction or whether an intrinsic defect in the ability of B cells to respond to T cell help underlies the lack of germinal center responses seen in Lyme Borreliosis. Together these studies will elucidate mechanisms that lead to the failure of the vigorous but ultimately deficient B cell response to facilitate clearance from Borrelia infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lyme Disease is a chronic disabling disease resulting from a tick-bite. The tick transfers a bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi to the patient which can persist in various organs including the joints and heart where it can cause disabling disease such as chronic arthritis and heart muscle disease. The body develops an immune response that can initially fend off disease but cannot clear the infection. Thus if infections are not treated continuing disease is common. This proposal aims to determine why the immune response that is sufficient to help to reduce disease ultimately fails to clear the infection. Such information is necessary to develop vaccines and treatments for this increasingly prevalent disease.      ","376236",

EBV is also recognized as an important pathogen in immunosuppressed individuals causing a variety of proliferative disorders including immunoblastic lymphomas oral hairy leukoplakia and an unusual tumor of muscle origin in immunosuppressed children. EBV is also a factor in a variety of other human malignancies including some T-cell lymphomas Hodgkin lymphoma Burkitt's lymphoma and gastric carcinoma. The pathologies suggest a wide variety of tissue tropism for EBV in vivo. In vitro and in vivo the cells that are most susceptible to EBV infection and permissive for viral replication are of B cell origin. The major viral envelope glycoprotein 350 (gp350) binds to the complement receptor type two (CD21) that is abundantly expressed on B cells. Fusion of the virion membrane with the cell membrane minimally requires a complex of viral proteins that includes gB gH gL and gp42. gp42 has been specifically found to bind to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II and this interaction is required for EBV entry into B lymphocytes. To date little is known about the mechanism that EBV uses to bind and penetrate B cells. This proposal will analyze the role of gp42 and its interaction with HLA for viral entry by structure-function studies. Clarifying the interactions between cellular receptors and viral glycoproteins is essential for understanding the tropisms behind EBV associated diseases.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research represents a collaborative research program between Dr. Longnecker and Dr. Jardetzky to define the molecular mechanisms involved in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) entry into B lymphocytes the major target cell of EBV in human hosts. EBV is associated with a variety of hematopoietic epithelial and lymphoproliferative diseases and the proposed research may result in the identification of new therapeutics for EBV infections as well as the herpesvirus family in general of which EBV is a member.      ","430471",

SMG develops through branching morphogenesis from an epithelial bud into a tree-like structure consisting of an array of ducts terminating in secretory acini. SMG morphogenesis involves cycles of growth and new bud formation that are tightly coordinated with the expansion and branching of ductal structures. The regulatory signals that guide the specification expansion and differentiation of acinar and ductal progenitors into an organized three dimensional structure are largely unknown. Because cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions have been shown to regulate morphogenetic changes during epithelial tissue development we have focused on E-cadherin a principal salivary cell-cell adhesion receptor and 1321 integrin the receptor for laminin a major component of the basement membrane in the SMG. Our studies have shown that the patterns of acinar and ductal cell fate are established at the initial bud stage and maintained throughout morphogenesis. Acinar progenitors are restricted to the peripheral cell layer in contact with the basement membrane while the interior bud cells comprise proliferating ductal progenitors and non-proliferating differentiating duct cells. E-cadherin is required for diverse functions of these cells during SMG morphogenesis. In the acinar progenitor cells E-cadherin junctions are stabilized through the interaction with 1321 integrin to regulate the coordination of acinar progenitor cell proliferation with new bud formation. Similar mechanism for stabilization of E-cadherin junctions is found in renal cells where 1321 integrin organizes multiprotein scaffolds. Our studies also show that the mass producing proliferating ductal progenitors maintain immature E-cadherin junctions by the activity of Src. Later in morphogenesis Src appears to be counteracted by the recruitment of phosphatases SHP2 and/or PTP< to promote duct formation. During duct development stable E-cadherin junctions signal differentiation and protection from apoptotic death most likely through the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Our hypothesis is that E-cadherin-mediated functions in different aspects of SMG morphogenesis and differentiation are regulated by association with structural and signaling molecules. We propose to test this hypothesis by investigating the mechanisms underlying changes in E-cadherin adhesive activity in distinct cell populations during SMG morphogenesis in three aims: 1) examine whether 1321 integrin stabilizes E-cadherin junctions in the acinar progenitor cells through the recruitment of scaffold proteins; 2) examine if coordination of SMG growth with ductal cell differentiation involves regulation of E-cadherin function by Src and subsequent signaling from E-cadherin junctions to PI3 kinase; and 3) examine the hypothesis that protein phosphatases regulate E-cadherin cell-cell contacts during maturation of salivary cells in the developing SMG. Diseases of the salivary glands including cancer and Sjogren's Syndrome are characterized by the disruption of cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. Our studies focus on the functions of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion receptors and their regulation during salivary gland development. Understanding how these adhesion receptors drive morphogenetic events is essential for the design of effective therapeutics that will target diseased salivary tissues as well as for the bioengineering of salivary glands and tissue replacement.      ","354799",

It is hypothesized that non-invasive imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor and predict responses to anti-cancer drugs and hence improve efficiency of drug development. Many potential imaging biomarkers exist and a significant barrier to their use is simply making the right choice for each drug-cancer combination. The current project seeks to reduce the dimensionality of this problem by investigating multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) endpoints to targeted therapies in animal models. This work is predicated on the explicit assumption that these results can empirically and rationally determine appropriate imaging endpoints in a clinical trial setting.  Prior work by our group and others has identified a number of useful MR imaging endpoints for drug therapy including diffusion (DW) MRI dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI 1H magnetic resonance   spectroscopy (MRS) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI. In animals these can all be obtained in a single imaging session and will be used to monitor the effect of PX-866 a novel inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and sunitinib a small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases VEGF-R and PDGF-R. These will be used against a panel of breast cancer tumor xenografts with differential sensitivities to these drugs. Primary goals of this work are to: (1) determine which of these MR imaging biomarkers are most useful for each drug; and (2) whether imaging biomarker responses can differentiate between these drug classes. Aim 1 will investigate this by assessing tumor and molecular responses to PX-866 and sunitinib. Aim 2 will assess the imaging responses to these drugs to determine which imaging endpoints are most appropriate as response biomarkers and Aim 3 will retrospectively analyze the pre-therapy images to determine if any biomarker (or combination) would have been useful in predicting response.   This work will advance our knowledge by: (1) determining which imaging biomarkers are most appropriate for these cancer models and these drugs; (2) identifying imaging phenotypes that may be predictors of response; and (3) developing novel and more sensitive methods of image analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Diagnostic radiology is undergoing a revolution as it transforms from a discipline focused on anatomy to one that can non-invasively interrogate tissue function and molecular phenotypes.

Current techniques for the quantification of neuropathy either lack sensitivity (quantitative sensory testing) require expert assessment and assess only the fastest conducting myelinated fibers (electrophysiology) or are invasive (skin/nerve biopsy). Our recent work with corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) confirms that it is a rapid non- invasive in-vivo clinical examination technique which accurately quantifies nerve damage and repair is comparable to skin biopsy (an accepted gold standard for assessing small fiber damage) and is able to demonstrate early nerve repair after pancreas transplantation. We now propose to establish CCM as a valid surrogate for human DPN through a set of coordinated studies. First to establish its ability to diagnose and assess progression of neuropathy we will compare CCM with other established tests of neuropathy in a cohort of patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and diabetic patients with mild neuropathy over a period of 4 years. Additionally to confirm the ability of CCM to measure therapeutic efficacy we will compare it with other FDA approved standard tests for neuropathy in patients undergoing pancreas transplantation. Finally we will explore the role of tear nerve growth factor expression in relation to corneal nerve morphology to provide insights into the pathogenesis of corneal and hence somatic nerve fiber damage.

Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are often observed in conjunction with additional risk factors including obesity atherogenic dyslipidemia hyperglycemia hypertension and a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory state which together characterize the ""metabolic syndrome"". Our research group has focused on NF-?B activation in type 2 diabetes and we and others have identified 3 mechanisms leading to activation of NF-?B. First we have reported increased expression of numerous NF-?B-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines chemokines and growth factors in the renal cortex of db/db mice indicating a dysregulated and prolonged activation of the NF-?B canonical pathway. Second we have reported that diabetes alters NF-?B noncanonical pathway proteins in renal cortex and we have localized these proteins to renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (pTEC). Third we have identified another alternative pathway of NF-?B activation that involves phosphorylation of RelA serine536. Based on our animal studies we postulate that diabetes activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-?B pathways leading to renal inflammation. Since NF-?B activation is rapidly arrested an important unanswered question is why this does not occur in diabetic tissues where canonical pathway activation of the innate immune response persists chronically. We hypothesize that diabetes-induced activation of NF-?B noncanonical pathways plays a causal role in prolonging the innate immune response activated by the canonical pathway contributing significantly to the progression of complications. In order to test this hypothesis we will use a human pTEC tissue culture system to probe molecular mechanisms involved in canonical vs. noncanonical NF- ?B pathway activation in response to stimuli that mimic the in vivo diabetic milieu. In Aim 1 we will identify the time-dependent activation profile of the two NF-?B pathways in human pTEC exposed to elevated glucose advanced glycated endproducts (AGE) and angiotensin-II (Ang-II) using NF-?B pathway-specific reporter-gene assays. In Aim 2 we will explore the role of NIK in NF-?B noncanonical pathway activation induced by glucose AGE and Ang-II by employing NIK-specific siRNA and by overexpressing NIK-wild type or kinase-dead dominant-negative NIK mutants. Aim 3 will characterize the activation kinetics and nuclear processing of RelB in human renal pTEC and Aim 4 will determine the significance of RelA phosphorylation on serine536 as another alternative noncanonical NF-kB pathway signaling mechanism in pTEC. The results obtained from the proposed aims will provide invaluable insights into molecular mechanisms by which diabetes induces and maintains chronic inflammation in the kidney. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our research group has focused on the role of inflammation and NF-?B activation in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Using human proximal tubular epithelial cells in tissue culture together with in vivo manipulation of NF-?B proteins we are exploring an important unanswered question - why is NF-?B canonical pathway activation not rapidly arrested in diabetic tissues where NF-?B activation of the innate immune response persists chronically. Results of this research have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets to treat diabetic nephropathy.      ","320875",

Despite identification of the precise genetic abnormality associated with this disease the mechanism by which the polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-7 causes selective neurotoxicity is not known. In a transgenic mouse model of SCA7 (polyglutamine expanded ataxin-7 expressed under the control of the prion protein promoter) degeneration of the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC's) occurs in a non-cell autonomous fashion. Ultra-structural analysis of this SCA7 model revealed a pattern of PC degeneration observed when PC injury is caused by excitotoxic insult. The ultra-structural evaluation of SCA7 mice also revealed evidence for pathology in several cerebellar elements including loss of climbing fiber input and dramatic changes in the morphology of Bergmann glia. Additionally ataxic SCA7 mice demonstrate loss of trophic factors normally supplied by climbing fibers and Bergmann glia. Taken together these observations support the hypothesis that PC degeneration in SCA7 is secondary to an altered extra-cellular environment. In this proposal we plan to address the question of how mutant ataxin-7 alters the PC environment resulting in PC degeneration. First we will perform comprehensive behavioral histological and ultra structural analysis of the natural history of PC degeneration in SCA7 knock-in mice and mice expressing the mutant protein in specific cellular populations of the cerebellum using a conditional inactivation strategy. Second two specific aspects of the extracellular environment will be examined: Neurotrophic factors and Neurotransmitter homeostasis. The specific alterations in the cerebellar environment that are associated with the onset of the disease phenotype in transgenic and knock-in mouse models of SCA7 will be further characterized. Additionally experiments attempting to normalize the cerebellar environment in SCA7 mice will be initiated in order to determine if restoring neurotrophic support or preventing excitotoxicty will subsequently delay or prevent the disease phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overriding objective of this proposal is to further define the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) an inherited neurodegenerative disease. The long-term aim is to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in this devastating neurodegenerative disease.      ","312000",

An improved understanding of cellular mechanisms of chemoresistance is essential in developing new effective anticancer therapy to overcome the problem of chemoresistance. We have shown that HtrA1 a serine protease with previously unknown function is down-regulated in a majority of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Additional studies indicated that HtrA1 may modulate cell death and anchorage independent growth of ovarian cancer cells [2]. Our more recent data indicate that HtrA1 is upregulated by cisplatin and paclitaxel and suggests that it may contribute to sensitivity to chemotherapy. Increased cell death and chemosensitivity following HtrA1 expression depends on the protease activity of HtrA1 suggesting a role of serine protease activity in programmed cell death (PCD). Moreover 90% of patients (27/30) with tumors expressing high levels of HtrA1 responded to chemotherapy with complete or partial clinical remissions compared to 62% (8/13) and 65% (11/17) response rates in tumors with low and moderate levels of HtrA1 respectively. Response to chemotherapy was significantly different between low and high (P = 0.0276) or moderate and high (P = 0.0342) staining groups. These findings identify HtrA1 as a novel modulator of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and suggest that loss of HtrA1 in ovarian cancer may contribute to chemoresistance [5]. The objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms by which HtrA1 expression is regulated in cancer and define the role of HtrA1 in programmed cell death and chemoresistance. Based on our preliminary studies we are proposing the following three hypotheses: first HtrA1 expression is epigenetically regulated in cancer and is transcriptionally upregulated by chemotherapy in cancer cells when its expression is not silenced by epigenetic mechanisms; second HtrA1 participates in a ""serine proteasome""-mediated PCD that cross-talks with caspase-mediated cell death pathways; and third targeted degradation of specific substrates by HtrA1 following chemotherapy treatment contributes to chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Emerging evidence suggests that some of the same changes that contribute to neoplastic transformation also contribute to drug resistance. In particular the same anti-apoptotic changes that contribute to the transformed phenotype by making cells resistant to the stresses of unfavorable growth conditions and loss of important homeostatic processes also appear to make cells more resistant than they would otherwise be to cancer chemotherapy. Based on this view studies that improve our understanding of the process of tumorigenesis have the potential to also provide new insight into the problem of drug resistance. Our studies have shown that altered expression of the serine protease HtrA1 modulates chemotherapy induced cytotoxicity. At the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to elucidate the significance of HtrA1 down-regulation in ovarian cancer and how this reduced HtrA1 expression contributes to the development of chemoresistant ovarian cancer. A better understanding of the role of HtrA1 in a poorly understood serine protease mediated programmed cell death may contribute to discoveries of new therapeutic approaches to overcome drug resistance. Drug resistant ovarian cancer is a lethal disease and this project will better define novel mechanisms of drug resistance and programmed cell death in ovarian cancer.      ","305050",

However the dose of opioid required to control pain varies up to 10-fold between individuals. In addition large inter-individual differences exist in the degree to which patients suffer side effects from opioids such as sedation pruritus or nausea. Moreover it is not known why some individuals become addicted to opioids while others do not. The principal hypothesis to be evaluated is that the degree of analgesia provided by opioids in humans displays substantial familial aggregation and is in fact heritable. These studies will use a classical twin paradigm to determine the role of genetics and the environment in influencing analgesia and a range of other opioid effects. Specific Aims: (1) Determine the degree to which opioid analgesic responses show familial aggregation and make preliminary estimates of heritability using both a heat pain model and a model of inflammatory pain with central sensitization. (2) Determine the degree to which non- analgesic opioid responses show familial aggregation and make preliminary estimates of heritability. Side effects such as sedation nausea respiratory depression and pruritus as well as the positive affective response a measure of abuse potential will be monitored. Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (125 total pairs) will be tested under controlled pain laboratory conditions for their responses to opioid infusion using the complementary pain models while monitoring side effects and additional psychometric indices of mood sleep and abuse potential. The selected models provide unique mechanistic information because they involve different peripheral and/or central pain pathways. DNA samples will be collected for zygosity testing and banked for future studies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Establishing a significant heritable component to human responses to opioids could lead to new analgesic strategies tailored to an individual's genetic makeup thus reducing patient risk and speeding control of pain. In addition future large scale candidate gene and genome wide association studies based on these results could uncover key genes involved in pain and analgesic pathways leading to more rational therapeutic targeting and ultimately more cost- effective treatments.      ","573067",

Severe abdominal pain is the most prominent symptom however the mechanisms of pancreatic inflammatory pain are poorly understood and consequently the therapeutic strategies are unsophisticated. The long term goal of this proposal is to identify the major mediators of pancreatic neurogenic inflammation and pain and to develop novel therapies for these conditions. We propose to study pathways involved both in the initiation and termination of inflammatory pain in the pancreas. Although ion channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family are known to promote inflammation and pain in somatic models and we have shown that TRPV1 mediates pancreatic inflammatory pain via the release of neuropeptides both in the pancreas and spinal cord whether the newer ion channels TRPV4 and TRPA1 participate in pancreatic inflammation and pain is unknown. TRPV4 responds to mechanical sheer stress osmotic changes as well as certain arachidonic acid metabolites released during inflammation. TRPV4 is expressed by pancreatic sensory neurons and our preliminary results show that it mediates nociception since either injection of TRPV4 agonists into the pancreatic duct or initiation of experimental pancreatitis result in activation of nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord (assessed by fos expression) in wild-type mice with diminished effects in TRPV4-/- animals. Moreover proteases such as trypsin that are prematurely-activated in the inflamed pancreas and can cleave and activate protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) sensitize TRPV4. Experiments are designed to define the mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators sensitize TRPV4 in pancreatic neurons to promote the release of neuropeptides that cause neurogenic inflammation and pain. We have recently discovered that 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) an aldehyde generated by the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on membrane lipids is an endogenous agonist of TRPA1 which causes peptide release neurogenic inflammation and pain. TRPA1 promotes pancreatic inflammatory pain since our preliminary results show that intraductal agonists and experimental pancreatitis stimulate fos expression and inflammation in TRPA1 wild-type mice with markedly reduced effects in TRPA1-/- animals. Experiments are designed to define the expression of TRPA1 in pancreatic neurons to determine the effects of lipid peroxidation products such as HNE on neurogenic pancreatic inflammation and nociception to determine how the pro-inflammatory peptide bradykinin sensitizes TRPA1 and to investigate the contribution of TRPA1 to neurogenic inflammation and pain in several models of experimental pancreatitis. Finally we will investigate pathways that terminate pancreatic inflammation by examining the role of metalloendopeptidases that degrade proinflammatory peptides on the cell surface and in endosomes. We will determine whether neutral endopeptidase (NEP) a cell surface enzyme that degrades at least 11 peptides including substance P and bradykinin attenuates pancreatic inflammation and pain and to evaluate whether administration of recombinant human NEP is a novel anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent. We have recently discovered that endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) degrades pro-inflammatory peptides in endosomes to thereby promote recycling and resensitization of endocytosed receptors. Experiments are designed to determine whether ECE-1 inhibitors by preventing receptor recycling inhibit resensitization of neurogenic inflammation in the pancreas and are thus novel anti-inflammatory agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pancreatic inflammation results in morbidity and mortality with severe intractable pain. The mechanisms of acute pancreatitis and pancreatitis pain are very poorly understood. The overall objective of our proposal is to identify key mediators of pancreatic inflammation and pain and to evaluate novel therapies for these conditions. Specifically we will determine the role of newly-identified ion channels on pancreatic sensory nerves. Once activated or sensitized in the inflamed pancreas these channels induce the release of neuropeptides from sensory nerves in the pancreas and the spinal cord where peptides cause neurogenic inflammation and pain respectively. Thus antagonists of these channels may prevent pancreatic inflammatory pain. We will also evaluate whether recombinant human peptidases which degrade proinflammatory and nociceptive peptides ameliorate inflammatory pain and are thus novel therapeutic agents. We determine whether inhibitors of peptidases in endosomes that regulate the recycling and resensitization of neuropeptide receptors prevent the sustained signaling of these peptides and thereby ameliorate neurogenic inflammation and pain.        ","328047",

It is often a significant communicative problem for the individual limiting educational and employment opportunities and social and psychological adjustment. The precise etiology of stuttering is unknown and treatment strategies and outcomes are highly variable. A major impediment to understanding the etiology of stuttering and to the development of successful therapeutic techniques is the lack of understanding of the physiological bases of the disorder especially as the disorder emerges in the pre-school years. Stuttering manifests itself as a breakdown in speech motor processes. The complex factors known to affect the occurrence of stuttering must ultimately have an effect on the physiological events necessary for the production of speech. There has been significant progress in understanding the physiological bases of stuttering in adults. Stuttering however is a developmental disorder with an average age of onset of 3-years. There is almost no work on the physiology of stuttering in young children to help us understand the developmental physiology and the etiology of the disorder. In our theoretical framework on stuttering we posit that motor linguistic cognitive psychosocial and genetic factors play a role in the onset and development of stuttering. Further it seems likely that the influence of these factors changes over the lifespan of the individual who stutters. We elect to focus in this project primarily on motor and linguistic factors in preschool children who are stuttering and their normally fluent peers. We hypothesize that stuttering emerges when a child fails to acquire stable motor control and coordination processes for speech thus making him or her vulnerable to breakdown in the face of increased processing demands. We test the hypothesis that children who stutter lag their normally fluent peers in developing speech motor control and coordination processes. Furthermore we assess whether the speech motor systems of children who stutter are exceptionally sensitive to increased linguistic processing demands. We seek to determine if language processing differences detected in the brain activity of adults who stutter are also evident in the early years of stuttering. By employing a longitudinal experimental design we can determine whether a set of physiological measures related to language and motor functions can discriminate children who will persist in stuttering from those who will recover. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present we have no means to predict which preschool children who are stuttering (5% of the preschool population) will develop a chronic stuttering problem and who will recover. Stuttering is not a life-threatening disorder but it is a life-altering disorder and educational achievement psychosocial development and employment opportunities are often negatively affected in the1% of Americans who persist in stuttering into adulthood. Our goal is to use physiological measures to develop a set of tests that can predict which preschool children who are stuttering are likely to develop a chronic problem so that early and more successful interventions for stuttering can be developed.        ","610410",

In the heart muscle opening of KATP channels participate in the stress response and protect against ischemic episodes. In the coronary vasculature K(ATP/NDP) channels contribute to the regulation of basal flow as well as responses to metabolic impairment (hypoxic dilatation and ischemic reactive hyperemia). We found glycolytic enzymes to associate with KATP channel subunits We hypothesize that glycolytic enzymes are integral components of the KATP channel macromolecular complex and that glycolytic enzymes regulate KATP channel activity under physiological and pathophysiological conditions both in the cardiac myocyte as well as in the coronary smooth muscle and endothelium. In a first Specific Aim we will investigate the hypothesis that enzymes of the glycolytic complex are associated with the KATP channel. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays we will investigate the specificity of interaction of glycolytic enzymes with individual KATP channel subunits (Kir6.1 Kir6.2 SUR1 SUR2A and SUR2B). Co-immunoprecipitation assays of native proteins will be performed to investigate interactions under physiologically relevant conditions. Protein interactions will also be investigated using advanced proteomic approaches (ICAT & ITRAQ) which has the potential to uncover additional novel KATP channel interacting proteins. In a second Aim we will examine the hypothesis that physical interaction of glycolytic enzymes with KATP channel subunits is required and that channel modulation occurs because of altered nucleotide levels in the microenvironment of the channel complex. This will be accomplished using mutant KATP channel subunits (lacking interaction with glycolytic enzymes or altered nucleotide sensitivity). In a final Aim we will investigate the interaction of glycolysis and KATP channels in the context of ischemic protection in cardiac myocytes and the coronary vasculature. To this end we will utilize our genetic mouse models that express dominant-negative K(ATP) channel subunits specifically in the cardiac myocyte smooth muscle or endothelium. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the role of KATP channels in the heart and coronary vasculature under physiological and non-pathophysiological conditions.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In many cell types there is an important link between intracellular energy metabolism and membrane excitability which affects physiological process as diverse as insulin secretion control of blood flow and protection of the heart against ischemia. We propose to examine one of the main effectors in this context namely the ATP-sensitive K+ channel and how the channel is specifically controlled by the initial step in glucose metabolism namely glycolysis. Understanding this modality of channel regulation will further our knowledge of the known protective effects of the KATP channel in myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular disease.      ","573400",

These impairments contribute to the functional disability of the disorder are likely related to genetic risk for the illness and are largely unaffected by antipsychotic treatment. This translational research program involves collaboration between a clinical research laboratory and a team of basic cognitive scientists with expertise in attention and working memory. Our approach is to use the concepts and methods of contemporary cognitive neuroscience to subdivide the constructs of attention and working memory into individual subcomponents so that specific falsifiable hypotheses can be constructed. The proposal includes 4 interrelated specific aims. In Aim 1 we examine the hypothesis that the illness compromises the ability to use goals to control attention leading to deficits in perception working memory and response selection. In Aim 2 we examine the interactions of attention and working memory and examine how impairments in each impact the other system. In Aim 3 we test the hypothesis that the illness compromises the ability to rapidly form precise working memory representations thereby degrading behavioral performance. In Aim 4 we address individual differences in working memory and attentional performance among patients in order to determine whether patients vary along a single severity of impairment continuum or instead differ in kind. Behavioral and neurophysiological experimental paradigms were chosen for their ability to isolate specific attention and working memory processes yielding large distinctive patterns of results in normal subjects thereby increasing the opportunity to observe specific interpretable deficits in SC. These data will provide new insight into the cognitive/neural systems that are impaired in SC potentially clarifying the nature of the phenotype and provide new targets for pharmacological treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most patients with schizophrenia suffer from significant disability for most of their adult lives. Impairments in attention and working memory have been shown to play an important role in determining the extent of disability that patients experience. This research program is designed to increase understanding of the specific processes that are involved in these important areas of cognitive impairment.            ","713225",

The specific objective of this proposal is to identify reliable biomarkers derived from proteins DNA aberrations and gene expression patterns in paraffin-embedded primary breast tumors that predict response to adjuvant trastuzumab (an antibody directed against HER2). These patients were enrolled in the landmark NCCTG-sponsored adjuvant N9831intergroup trial (EA Perez-PI) that led to dramatic changes in the clinical care of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Our overall hypothesis is that tissue markers associated with EGF-family signaling pathways will predict those patients more likely to respond to adjuvant trastuzumab. Our specific aims include three translational studies: 1) To determine the tissue expression of select proteins involved in the mechanisms of trastuzumab activity and resistance using conventional immunohistochemistry and Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA); 2) To determine DNA aberrations of specific genes that have been suggested to be associated with trastuzumab response using fluorescence in situ hybridization; and 3) To identify gene expression patterns predictive of trastuzumab benefit using DASL a gene expression profiling system specifically designed for paraffin tissue. Our multidisciplinary team has the experience to accomplish these important translational protein- and gene-based studies within the proposed timeline. We have collected all relevant specimens to conduct this investigation as well as the clinical follow-up data related to disease free and overall survival. Results from these correlative studies using the well-defined N9831 patient population will provide a better understanding of individual variation of benefit to adjuvant trastuzumab and will identify opportunities for therapeutic intervention for patients at increased risk of recurrence. As this is achieved it will be possible to more effectively tailor therapy with the greatest efficiency and fewest side effects. Positive results from these proposed correlative studies will also allow us to design further phase II and III clinical trials addressing our overall goal of individualized therapy for patients with breast cancer.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biomarker identification and validation studies are necessary to successfully achieve personalized medicine. This is critically important in the adjuvant management of patients with resected HER2-positive breast cancer as trastuzumab treatment significantly increases disease free and overall survival but is associated with potential toxicities. Our study proposes biomarker tissue correlative studies to help identify those patients most likely to benefit from this treatment.       ","386094",

Recent studies provide evidence that plant stomata pores in the epidermis of plants function in innate immunity against the entry of bacteria into the plant. Specifically stomata close in response to Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 or bacterial PAMPs. Perception of PAMPs by guard cells the pair of cells that forms the stomatal pore requires a flagellin receptor as well as production and signaling of the plant hormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid. The virulent plant pathogen Pst DC3000 produces the phytotoxin coronatine (COR) to suppress stomatal closure as a virulence strategy. Collectively these results suggest an important role of stomata in modulating the interactions of plants with plant and human pathogenic bacteria in the phyllosphere (the leaf surface).     The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the signal transduction pathway leading to stomate- based defense and to dissect the mechanism by which the bacterial toxin COR inhibits this novel host defense. The central hypotheses to be tested are that (i) stomate-based defense is an integral part of the plant's natural immune response to restrict the entry of bacteria including human pathogenic bacteria and (ii) to be successful plant pathogens must rely on specific virulence factors or environmental conditions to suppress stomate-based defense. An integrative approach involving molecular genetics microscopy and biochemical and pathogenesis assays will be used. The proposed research will contribute to the fundamental knowledge of innate immunity and bacterial pathogenesis in plants and will increase our understanding of the molecular basis of plant-human pathogen interactions in the phyllosphere. Human pathogen contamination of fresh vegetables is a major public health concern and a potential bio-terrorist threat as a source of food poisoning.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal describes basic research on the molecular basis of innate immunity of the model plant Arabidopsis to plant and human pathogenic bacteria. Food contamination with human pathogens is a major concern to public health. This research has the potential to provide a mechanistic understanding of plant defense and human pathogen contamination of fresh produce and to guide future development of appropriate prevention measures.      ","380328",

Recent advances in nanotechnology have raised exciting possibilities for the application of nanomaterials to biomedical imaging and the targeted delivery of drugs. We have recently developed a novel nanoparticle formulation with potent stimulatory effects on the formation of osteoblasts the cells responsible for bone formation and concomitant inhibitory effects on the formation of osteoclasts the cells responsible for bone breakdown (resorption). This nanoparticle may have the potential to be developed into a powerful dual anticatabolic and proanabolic agent for the treatment of numerous osteoporotic diseases. However before any reagent can be developed into a drug for use in humans it is imperative to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which it regulates cell metabolism in order to assess its likely safety profile in vivo and to understand potential toxic or non-specific side-effects on skeletal and non-skeletal cells. Our preliminary studies suggest that that this nanoparticle formulation achieves its stimulatory effects on osteoblasts and inhibitory effects on osteoclasts by a mechanism involving the suppression of the Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor. The NF-kB signal transduction pathway is established to be critical for production of bone resorbing osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. By contrast we and others have recently reported that the NF-kB pathway is potently inhibitory to osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization in vitro. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that  this novel nanoparticle formulation inhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates osteoblast activity by suppressing the NF-kB signal transduction pathway.  In Specific Aim 1 we propose to investigate the action of this nanoparticle on the NF-kB signal transduction pathway in differentiating osteoclast and osteoblast precursors. In Specific Aim 2 we will generate variants of the wild type nanoparticle possessing different physical and chemical properties including alterations to surface charge surface decoration and size to determine which specific attributes are responsible for internalization entry into the cell and biological action on the NF-kB pathway. Finally in Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the potential for this nanoparticle formulation to enhance bone mineral density and bone structure by stimulating osteoblastic bone formation and inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption in mice in vivo.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Nanotechnology has the power to revolutionize medicine. We recently developed a nanoparticle capable of inhibiting bone breakdown while simultaneously stimulating new bone formation. We now seek to fully investigate the action of this particle on bone cells and test its capacity to enhance bone mass in vivo.      ","374533",

Within this context amphiphilic biodegradable polymers that can self assemble into nano-sized structures have been identified as a promising platform for the development of cutaneous delivery carriers. There is also consensus that a better understanding of the complex interactions that control the biological responses of cells and tissue to nano- sized carriers is of high importance. This application addresses both issues. Our unique nanosphere system is based on a biodegradable biocompatible and non-cytotoxic polymer that provides a high degree of structural versatility for complexing lipophilic therapeutics. The nanospheres were formed by the self-assembly of ABA- type amphiphilic triblock copolymer derived exclusively from natural metabolites. A-blocks are poly(ethylene glycol) PEG and hydrophobic B-blocks are oligomers of desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine alkyl esters (DTR) and non- toxic diacids. The choice of oligo(DTR-diacid) for the middle block was based on its tunable hydrophobicity and degradability under physiological conditions. Modulation of cell behavior and non-fouling characteristics of non- cytotoxic and biocompatible PEG makes it attractive for in vivo applications. Additionally the presence of PEG could provide superior hydration of the skin thereby increasing the skin permeation ability of nanospheres. No other group has demonstrated successful topical skin delivery in vitro using hollow nanospheres based on a fully biodegradable self-assembling triblock copolymer that possesses immunomodulatory activities of tissue necrosis factor antagonists. Our nanospheres significantly enhanced skin penetration of highly lipophilic model agents in human cadaver skin compared to a non-particulate formulation. No detectable transdermal permeation was observed even after 24 hours application suggesting that these nanospheres can be used in topical drug delivery. In addition major advantages of the polymeric system proposed here include (i) ease of formulation of nano-sized hollow spheres in an ideal size range and narrow distribution (ii) complete degradability (iii) non-toxicity and (iv) chemical diversity allowing for structural modifications and optimization. We plan to use this novel approach to identify a set of generally applicable design parameters for the development of optimized and biologically compatible topical delivery carriers. Our goal is to study the feasibility of tyrosine-derived nanospheres as delivery vehicles for a wide range of lipophilic drugs into the skin as well as nanospheres interactions with healthy and diseased skin. This would result in better understanding of the barriers to efficient topical delivery and promote the design of a formulation for the delivery of psoriasis therapeutics. If successful the concepts proposed here have the potential to contribute significantly to the future development of skin-targeted applications. Biodegradable non-cytotoxic nanospheres loaded with lipophilic therapeutics will be prepared and optimized for the efficient delivery of drugs into the skin. These topical agents will provide new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of psoriasis while minimizing systemic cytotoxicity of harsh therapeutics. The nanosphere design is highly versatile and will significantly contribute to topical drug delivery applications.      ","318534",

Dr. James Craig of Indiana University will not be renewing his grant but instead will be joining this project at Johns Hopkins University. The broad goals of this application are to understand how two-dimensional shape texture and motion are represented in somatosensory cortex. Shape texture and motion are important in all sensory systems. We will use a 400-probe stimulator that can produce a wide range of dynamic patterns to stimulate the finger pad. We will perform both psychophysical studies in humans and neurophysiological studies in non-human primates. The first aim is to understand how complex patterns are perceived and represented in somatosensory cortex. In these experiments we will investigate how spatial features such as lines and curves are combined both spatially and temporally to from complex spatial patterns. The second aim is to investigate how texture is represented in somatosensory cortex. In these experiments we will use a wide range of spatial patterns that we used previously to study the peripheral mechanisms of texture perception to determine how texture is coded in cortex. The third aim is to investigate how motion is represented in cortex. In particular we will scan various spatial patterns across the finger pad at different directions and scanning velocities to determine how motion interacts with form and texture processing. The results from these studies will provide an understanding of the mechanisms underlying central neurological problems and will provide an understanding of the sensory feedback that is necessary for the control of prosthetic limbs. A third benefit is that these studies will aid in the development of cutaneous communication systems for the deaf and blind. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from the proposed studies will aid our understanding of the effects of both peripheral and central neurological problems and our interpretation of the results of neurological examinations such as changes in light touch thresholds spatial acuity and directional sensitivity. To provide sensory feedback for the control of prosthetic limbs it is important to understand how the hand normally processes touch information. In addition the proposed measures of the perceptibility of tactile patterns will aid in the development of cutaneous communication systems for the blind deaf and deaf-blind.      ","680589",

To date no toxic effects of pHLIP exposure have been observed either for cells in culture or for mice. Here we propose to develop a nanotechnology platform for selective delivery of imaging and therapeutic agents to tumors based on the use of the pHLIP-bionanosyringe. By attaching cargo molecules to the end of pHLIP that stays outside of the membrane we can anchor imaging or therapeutic probes to the surfaces of cancer cells facilitating diagnosis treatment and therapeutic monitoring. By attaching cargo to its inserted end via cleavable links pHLIP can be used for the selective translocation of polar cell-impermeable molecules into cancer cells. By combining the efforts of three laboratories a broad development of this promising technology will be possible. We will use pHLIP targeting to test cancer models and establish how tumor growth and development correlate with tumor acidity. To improve pHLIP technology we will design synthesize and test various dendrimeric-pHLIP constructs to enable delivery of multiple therapeutic and/or imaging probes to tumors. We will introduce a synthetic scheme of simultaneous conjugation of cargo molecules and fluorescent dyes to the C-terminus of pHLIP via a cleavable S-S bond and establish the properties (polarity shape charge and size) of cargo molecules that pHLIP can translocate through the lipid bilayer of a membrane defining a new polar class of therapeutic molecules that can be delivered for tumor treatment. We will test pHLIP for the intracellular delivery of two functional cell-impermeable molecules in vivo: a toxin (phalloidin) and a gene regulation agent (Peptide Nucleic Acid). Importantly we will attempt the simultaneous detection and treatment of tumors by labeled pHLIP-phalloidin which is our first lead for a potential antimetastatic drug. Further we will develop a two-step delivery scheme for the specific tethering and assembly of nanoparticles at the surfaces of cancer cells in vivo: 1) targeting tumors using pHLIP with a binding domain which will be tethered to the surface of cancer cells and 2) targeting the pHLIP with liposomes containing therapeutic and/or imaging payloads and having a surface-exposed complementary binding domain. Inspired by the properties of pHLIP in its current version we will further evaluate the effect of pHLIP sequence variation on peptide insertion into a membrane enabling the design of a second generation of the nanosyringe with a range of useful properties. pHLIP nanotechnology offers a new approach for the disease-specific imaging and treatment of cancers. Our ultimate goal is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer which is responsible for about 25% of all deaths in the USA and other developed countries. There are several aspects of the problem where our technology development could be useful but the major concept is the selective delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents to cells in tumors. Another aspect of the technology is that it permits the use of a new class of therapeutic agents: cell-impermeable molecules that would be translocated into cells only in diseased tissue while not affecting healthy cells. A therapy based on these concepts would exhibit much higher efficacy and/or significantly reduced side effects. Such improvements are especially important for cancer treatment since the majority of anti-cancer drugs are poisons that damage normal cells.      ","577034",

The proposal integrates several recent technological advances and capitalizes the availability of the Solexa system in our lab. Drs. Fu and Yeo have extensive experimental and computational expertise in RNA research and will jointly lead the team to carry out the proposed project in three specific aims: (1) We propose to couple the CLIP (Crosslinking ImmunoPrecipitation) technology with high throughput sequencing to identify in vivo binding sites for a large number of RNA binding proteins focusing initially on RNA binding proteins implicated in both constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA processing. The results are expected to generate novel biological and mechanistic insights into regulated RNA processing in humans. To prepare future expansion of the project we are working with an antibody production company to systematically generate antibodies against RNA binding proteins encoded in the human genome. (2) In parallel to physical mapping we will couple the oligo selection/ligation strategy previously developed in our lab with high throughput sequencing to perform digital analysis of alternative splicing. Having experienced all array-based systems for detecting mRNA isoforms we believe that the current experimental design will generate quantitative information on regulated splicing with both high sensitivity and specificity by overcoming all technical problems associated with array-based approaches. (3) We will perform bioinformatics analysis of both physical mapping and functional profiling data generated in aim 1 and 2 to deduce regulatory RNA elements in the human genome. The data will be further integrated with other large-scale analysis of genomic sequences such as computationally predicted RNA elements conservation across genomes and coupling with known splice sites. We believe that this project will make a unique contribution to RNA genomics as well as to our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in general.    Project Narrative: The expression of human genes is regulated at both DNA and RNA levels. Complementary to most effort devoted to decipher functional DNA elements this proposal focuses on functional RNA elements in the human genome by physical mapping of a large panel of RNA binding proteins coupled with functional analysis of alternative mRNA isoform expression. The experimentally generated data will be integrated with other large-scale analysis of computationally deduced RNA elements to understand general principle behind regulated gene expression at the RNA level which has a high potential to reveal a  code  for regulated splicing in human cells and shed new light on various disease mechanisms.      ","800000",

Patient age is among the most important risk factors for the onset and progression of glaucomatous damage regardless of the stage of glaucoma or the level of intraocular pressure (IOP) at which it has occurred. It is still unclear however how IOP triggers the cascade of events that lead to retinal ganglion cell death. We hypothesize that age-related alterations in ONH biomechanics contribute importantly to the increased susceptibility of the aged ONH in humans.     Using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the ONH and principles of biomechanical engineering we have studied the mechanical effects of elevated IOP in glaucoma. However the relationship between patient age and the mechanical effects of elevated IOP is still unclear. How is the ONH altered as in the older patient that increases its susceptibility to IOP? Is the robustness of the ONH connective tissues the key to understanding individual susceptibility to glaucoma? What role does the structural stiffness of the lamina cribrosa and peripapillary sclera play in the increased age-related risk for glaucomatous progression? To answer these questions we will use novel methods to elucidate the relationship between age and the IOP- induced deformation of ONH connective tissues are needed.     By ""ONH biomechanics"" we mean the interactions between IOP and connective tissue structural stiffness (the combination of tissue architecture and material properties) in the ONH and peripapillary sclera. The immediate goals of this project are to characterize age-related differences in ONH biomechanics and elucidate their effects on ONH susceptibility. Our long-term goal is to develop clinical diagnostics and interventions designed to manage each important biomechanical risk factor in the development and progression of glaucoma. To accomplish our immediate goals we will build digital three-dimensional reconstructions of young and old human ONH tissues quantify the ONH connective tissue architecture within each reconstruction and build computational finite element models of the ONH connective tissues to estimate their biomechanical response to normal and elevated levels of IOP. We will also correlate the age-related variations in ONH architecture tissue stiffness and biomechanical behavior with the increased susceptibility and clinical behavior of the aged ONH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) has long been assumed to play a causative role in glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve head (ONH) and older patients have higher risk of development and progression of the disease. We propose to measure the age-related differences in ONH structure and IOP-induced biomechanical response. Then using the principles of biomechanical engineering we will use these data to create computational models of the age-related mechanical effects of elevated IOP on the ONH to elucidate the link between advancing age and glaucomatous susceptibility.      ","388319",

The proposed research program consists of two components: (1) engineering development of the optical fiber and the femtosecond sources; and (2) medical validation of the all-fiber femtosecond sources when coupled with the existing multiphoton microscope and newly developed multiphoton medical endoscope for cancer research and cancer detection. The engineering component involves close collaboration between Cornell University and our industrial partner OFS Laboratories with design input from the collaborating biomedical researchers and practicing oncologists. The medical validation component leverages our existing development of multiphoton microscopy and endoscopy for cancer research. Experiments of in vivo animal imaging and spectroscopy will be performed at Cornell Ithaca Campus. Medical validation experiments will also be carried out at Cornell Weill Medical College in ex vivo human cancer after it has been removed surgically from the patient. The three specific aims are: 1. Design and fabricate novel HOM fiber modules for SSFS at input wavelengths of 1030 nm and 775 nm. 2. Demonstrate two all-fiber femtosecond sources with wavelength tuning ranges of (1) 775 nm to 1000 nm and (2) 1030 nm to 1300 nm. The output pulse energies will be first at 2 nJ and then at 5 to 10 nJ. We will then Integrate the all-fiber source with in-house developed multiphoton microscopes and endoscopes. 3. Medical validation of the new femtosecond sources coupled to the micro/endoscopes for multiphoton spectroscopy endoscopy and microscopy in cancer research and diagnostics. Our overall goal by the end of the grant period is to have a prototype all-fiber turn-key wavelength tunable femtosecond laser coupled seamlessly to a medical multiphoton micro/endoscope and medically validated in in vivo imaging of animal cancer model and ex vivo imaging of human cancer. The successful completion of this research program will undoubtedly benefit the multiphoton community in general and enable multiphoton in vivo imaging in clinical applications.    The proposed program if successfully completed leads to all-fiber wavelength tunable energetic femtosecond sources that will have a broad impact on multiphoton biomedical imaging. There are significant practical advantages offered by the all-fiber configuration such as compact foot print robust operation and operational safety in a clinical environment.

The major cause of severe vision loss in AMD is choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or the growth of new vessels under the retina. The pathogenesis of neovascular AMD is multifactorial but in general is considered to be driven by angiogenesis a process in which the cellular components of the new vessel complex are derived from cells from the adjacent pre-existing capillary. However an alternative mechanism termed ""postnatal vasculogenesis"" has been shown to contribute to some forms of neovascularization. In vasculogenesis the cellular components of the new vessel complex are derived in part from bone-marrow derived circulating cells. Our group has previously demonstrated that CNV in animal models is formed in part from these bone-marrow derived cells. In this proposal we will confirm and extend these findings to understand the contribution of the various cellular subsets within the circulation which may affect pathogenesis progression and severity of CNV. Initial work will be done in two rodent models of CNV the laser-induced and subretinal injection of an adenoviral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor. Isolation and depletion experiments will attempt to identify the specific cell types found within the rodent bone marrow which contribute to the CNV. Our group has also demonstrated that these bone-marrow vasculogenic cells can also be identified in the peripheral blood of patients with various degrees of AMD. In subsequent experiments we will confirm and extend our preliminary human findings and similar to the preclinical work performed in animals attempt to identify specific subsets of circulating cells which correlate with disease status. These results will be extended to include confirmatory experiments on patients undergoing surgical excision of CNV and the subsequent histologic analysis of the lesions. In addition a case-controlled human clinical trial will be performed to further correlate the presence absence or relative ratios of certain peripheral cells and the ability to predict development progression or severity of CNV in patients with AMD.

We rely on an augmented life-cycle model modified to incorporate essential aspects of the various pieces of the problems that we study to conduct our work. We focus on two factors that the literature (and we) believe are important influences on the wealth available for retirement. First despite a vast literature relying on the life-cycle model to examine wealth accumulation few papers focus on the role of children. Our work will highlight the role children play in wealth accumulation. In doing so we compare the effects of children on wealth to the effects if asset- and income-tested transfers on wealth. Our work also has potentially important implications for thinking about Social Security replacement rates. Second we will examine the role of pensions on non-pension wealth accumulation. While a large prior literature examines this topic our work differs by accounting fully for lifetime (past and future) resources. More importantly past estimates of the effects of pensions on non-pension wealth accumulation are difficult to interpret if there is a mixture of credit constrained and unconstrained households in the samples used for estimation. We clarify these issues and offer a new way of thinking about the effects of pensions on wealth accumulation.     Our third proposed project will examine the way in which wealth interacts with retirement expectations and retirement. One way for some households to respond to actual or perceived shortfalls (surpluses) in retirement wealth is to defer (hasten) retirement. We will use differences between actual and optimal net worth (derived from an augmented life cycle model with uncertainty) to study the way retirement expectations and wealth are correlated with retirement decisions. We will also develop and estimate the parameters from a new model of retirement. Our fourth project will provide a comprehensive look at the adequacy of retirement wealth preparation of households in different U.S. birth cohorts. In earlier work we showed that the original HRS cohort born between 1931 and 1941 overwhelmingly were on track in 1992 to having resources in retirement necessary to maintain their accustomed living standards. A critical unresolved issue however is the degree to which these results hold for other cohorts particularly those born after 1941. Our proposed work will answer this question. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose new fundamental analyses of factors central to understanding the living standards of Americans in and prior to retirement. There is a well-documented association between wealth and health. Understanding the factors associated with wealth accumulation may improve understanding of the health-wealth relationship. Moreover consumption and health are fundamental inputs to the well-being of elderly households. Our work will provide new models and empirical work on factors influencing consumption and hence well-being.      ","301243",

The dramatic reduction in the noise of these directional microphones will be accomplished by the integration of three novel technologies: 1) The development of a robust biologically-inspired microphone diaphragm having low thermal noise. Microphones having ideal noiseless electronic amplification will still produce noise in their output due to the random impacts of thermally excited air molecules on the diaphragm. The ability of the surrounding gas to impart energy to the diaphragm is directly related to the amount of vibration damping or passive energy dissipation in the system. In the proposed study optimized low-damping and hence low-noise diaphragm designs will be developed to create a directional microphone diaphragm having much lower thermal noise along with increased sensitivity to sound than can be achieve by currently available technology. 2) Optical sensing to convert the diaphragm motion into an electronic signal. In the proposed effort a revolutionary low-noise optical method will be developed for converting the motion of the diaphragm into an electronic signal. This optical scheme provides a highly sensitive low-noise method of obtaining an electronic output from the bio-inspired microphone diaphragms that adds negligible electronic noise. A miniaturized packaging scheme will be developed to integrate the optoelectronic components with the microphone diaphragm. 3) Electronic feedback for thermal noise reduction. As mentioned above a key contribution of this research will be the development of directional microphone diaphragms having a minimum of passive damping. While low damping leads to low noise it also leads to highly resonant ringing response which is certainly undesirable in a microphone. In the proposed effort an electronic feedback system will be developed to incorporate electronic damping to achieve the desirable response benefits of damping without the associated thermal noise. This approach to thermal noise reduction and active response control has been adopted in other low-noise sensing applications but it has previously not been feasible in microphone applications. The combination of the low damping directional microphone diaphragm and the optical sensing scheme to be developed here makes it possible to take advantage of this powerful technology in the design of low-noise miniature microphones.      ","577269",

Unfortunately the ability of the medical community to predict risk of breast cancer accurately for individual women remains limited. Risk assessment for other cancers is enhanced significantly when the tissue at risk can be examined for premalignant features (models include cervix colon esophagus etc). This suggests that a tissue-based strategy could enhance risk prediction for breast cancer. Of note the diagnostic categories seen in breast biopsies with benign findings (so-called benign breast disease [BBD]) - non-proliferative proliferative without atypia and atypical hyperplasia - are accepted by many to form a continuum in the progression toward breast cancer. This histological assessment can serve as a base to which other markers of risk can be added for the construction of tissue based risk prediction strategies for breast cancer. To this end we have assembled a large cohort of women with BBD identified at Mayo Clinic. Over the period of this proposed grant the cohort will be expanded to include ~ 13000 women who had biopsies 1967-2001 and who will have developed an expected ~ 1200 breast cancers. For the women in this Mayo BBD Cohort we have collected extensive histologic features along with clinical and epidemiologic risk factors. Original benign tissue will be available for all women included and these BBD tissue blocks will be used in the study of select biomarkers. In our work to date we have shown that robust discriminatory features are detectable within the benign tissue. These include the overall diagnostic category of BBD the extent of the proliferative process (e.g. number of foci) the extent of involution of background terminal duct lobular units and the expression of COX-2 the first biomarker tested. This further motivates our hypothesis that a comprehensive model that incorporates histologic and molecular features from benign breast tissue can enhance the precision of breast cancer risk prediction. The proposed work encompasses three aims that will be performed in a nested case-control series within the cohort: 1) test the calibration and discriminatory accuracy of the three available risk prediction models that incorporate BBDrelated data (Gail Tyrer-Cuzick Colditz-Rosner); 2) build a tissue-based risk prediction model that incorporates histologic and molecular features along with clinical and epidemiologic risk factors and 3) validate the best model from aim 2 in an independent set of cases and controls from Mayo and two external validation sets from BBD cohorts at Vanderbilt and Henry Ford Hospital. With the assessment of the performance of risk prediction tools in women with BBD and the construction and validation of a tissue-based risk prediction model we aim to improve the accuracy of breast cancer risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurate prediction of who is at increased risk for breast cancer is essential to identify those women who would benefit most from heightened surveillance and risk reduction strategies. Women who have had breast  biopsies with benign findings (approximately 1 million US women/year) are known to be at increased risk for a later breast cancer. In their tissue we have found strong correlates of risk of a later breast cancer. We will combine tissue-based histologic and biomarker information with standard risk factor data from a large cohort of women with benign breast biopsies to craft a comprehensive risk prediction model for breast cancer.          ","620705",

This failure to receive desired end-of-life care is attributed in large part to communication failures among patients families and clinicians. In order to improve end-of-life care interventions that result in improved communication are needed. Long-term Objectives: The long term objectives of this proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the efficacy of a facilitator-assisted interdisciplinary communication intervention in the ICU to improve family and patient outcomes; and 2) to demonstrate the feasibility of making this intervention a routine part of clinical practice in the ICU setting. Specific Aims: The study's specific aims are: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of a facilitator-assisted interdisciplinary communication intervention in the ICU to improve family symptoms of depression anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; 2) to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on the patient's quality of dying and death as evaluated by both families and nurses; and 3) to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on processes of care and processes of communication. Study Design: A five year randomized controlled study at 4 hospitals enrolling 480 patients 240 assigned to the intervention and 240 assigned to the control group. The intervention includes: 1) in-person interviews by the facilitator with the family prior to the family conference in order to discuss the family's concerns questions and communication needs; 2) a pre-conference meeting with the facilitator and the patient's clinicians in which the family's concerns questions and communication needs are discussed; 3) facilitator participation in the family conference; and 4) facilitator follow up with the family throughout the ICU stay. The efficacy of the intervention will be measured with quantitative measures collected at enrollment and at three months after the patient's death or discharge from the ICU. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention by comparing scores on questionnaires from the families and clinicians of intervention patients with scores on the questionnaires from the families and clinicians of the control patients who will receive usual care. Significance: This intervention designed to improve communication and decision-making about end-of-life care in the ICU offers significant potential benefits for improving patient- and family-centered care for several reasons: 1) communication is an integral component of clinician skill that affects all other aspects of end-of-life care; 2) physicians and nurses in practice do not demonstrate adequate skills for communicating about end-of-life care especially in the ICU or acute care setting; and 3) preliminary evidence suggests that interventions that have improved communication within the ICU team and between the team and the family have the potential to improve patient and family outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Twenty percent of deaths in the US occur in or shortly after a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) a setting in which technologically expensive care is delivered. End-of-life decisions are often made by family members in these settings but families report experiencing poor communication with clinicians making these decisions difficult. This proposal addresses the need for improving communication in ICU settings with a randomized trial of an interdisciplinary communication intervention in which a facilitator intervenes to assist and support communication efforts by all stakeholders. The facilitated communication intervention is designed to be easily generalizable to other hospitals and ICUs and if successful would improve the quality of care patients and their families receive in the ICU.          ","633064",

The derivation of cellular liver transplants from embryonic stem (ES) cells as an alternative source of tissue would need to be both autologous and free of the genetic disease requirements that are not easily surmountable and also ethically controversial with ES cells derived from potentially viable fertilized or patient-specific somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos. One approach to produce autologous disease-free ES cells from patients that may resolve these problems is the derivation of uniparental embryonic stem cells from the patient's gametes. Uniparental embryos such as parthenogenetic embryos have limited developmental capacity due to genomic imprinting but can produce ES cell lines. We have established that hematopoietic stem cells derived from murine uniparental ES cells can reconstitute adult hematopoiesis with no apparent pathology. To investigate the potential of uniparental cells for liver replacement we now propose to use maternally (oocyte)-derived (parthenogenetic /gynogenetic) and paternally derived (androgenetic; two sperm genomes) fetal ES cell derivatives to functionally repopulate the liver in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) deficient adults. As a therapeutic approach we will also transplant hepatic progenitors derived in vitro from uniparental ES cells. As each gamete contains a subset of the genome diploid uniparental embryos are homozygous at a proportion of loci that are heterozygous in the gamete donor. This can be exploited to produce patient-derived ES cells without an errant allele (including large genetic lesions) in diseases associated with heterozygosity. Using the heterozygous phenotypic PiZ mouse model for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency we will perform a proof of principle experiment involving elimination of the PiZ locus in uniparental ES cells. For patients of recessive genetic disorders mutant allele-free uniparental ES cell lines derived from parents or siblings could provide immune-compatible transplantable tissue since MHC homozygous mutant allele-free uniparental lines with a matched subset of the recipient's MHC could be identified. Using mouse strains with different MHC loci we will investigate the engraftment of MHC homozygous cellular liver transplants in MHC heterozygous recipients i.e. determine the relevance of hybrid resistance.This proposal will investigate the capacity of embryonic stem cells derived from oocytes or sperm only to be used for liver transplantation and correction of genetic liver diseases. These embryonic stem cells would be derived from the respective patient's sperm or oocytes and thus limit rejection problems associated with the use of existing embryonic stem cell lines.      ","345579",

These skills depend on complex patterns of activity-dependent plasticity throughout the CNS from the cortex to the spinal cord. The goal of this research program is to learn how this plasticity can be initiated and guided so as to improve motor function after injury or disease. This goal requires an experimental model based on a simple skill produced by defined and accessible neural circuitry. The spinal stretch reflex (SSR or tendon jerk) satisfies this requirement. Because its spinal pathway is influenced by the brain monkeys humans rats and mice can gradually increase or decrease the SSR or its electrical analog the H-reflex in response to an operant conditioning protocol. By the standard definition of ""skill"" as ""an adaptive behavior acquired through practice"" these reflex changes are simple motor skills. This laboratory is exploring the complex patterns of plasticity that underlie these skills and is learning how reflex conditioning can be used to help restore motor function after injury or disease. Recent work shows that soleus H-reflex conditioning changes soleus behavior during locomotion and suggests that appropriate conditioning can improve locomotion after a spinal cord injury. Based on this work this project will test two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that in normal rats the impact of soleus H-reflex conditioning on the soleus locomotor burst induces compensatory changes in the behavior of other muscles that preserve the symmetry of the step cycle and that these changes in the locomotor behavior of other muscles are due to plasticity in their reflex pathways. The second hypothesis is that in spinal-cord injured rats with abnormal locomotion appropriate reflex conditioning can improve the step cycle and that the improvement persists after conditioning ends. These hypotheses will be tested by studying normal rats and rats with well-defined spinal cord injuries before during and after up- or down-conditioning of the soleus H-reflex or other spinal reflexes. The impact of conditioning on the locomotor EMG activity and reflexes of soleus and other leg muscles and on the parameters of the step-cycle will be assessed. To evaluate the impact of conditioning on brain and spinal cord interactions concurrent effects on cortical motor and somatosensory evoked potentials will also be measured. The results should help to clarify the origin and functional impact of the complex plasticity underlying the acquisition and maintenance of motor skills. They should lead to novel methods that use reflex conditioning to improve function after spinal cord injury or other trauma or disease. Reflex conditioning protocols might be designed to target the pathways underlying the particular deficits of each individual and could thereby complement other more general therapeutic methods such as locomotor training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motor skills are acquired and maintained throughout life by changes in the brain and the spinal cord. When skills are impaired by spinal cord injury or other disorders their restoration requires methods for promoting and guiding these changes. Spinal reflex conditioning is a powerful and precise new therapeutic method that can changespecificnervoussystempathwayssoastohelprestorecomplexmotorskillssuchaslocomotion.

Over the last 10-15 years fluorescent proteins have provided critical insights into the fundamental workings of the cell as they enable researchers to visualize protein movements enzyme activities gene expression and to quantify important signaling molecules in real time in living cells. As a result fluorescent proteins have truly revolutionized cell biology shedding light on the basic biology of cellular function while helping to elucidate what goes wrong in disease states. Substantial improvements in the signal output of fluorescent proteins are required for the next level: visualizing and monitoring of single molecules within individual living cells. Although there has been a concerted effort in the protein engineering field to enhance fluorescent protein properties recent improvements have been incremental at best. We hypothesize that an 80-fold improvement in signal output can be obtained by explicitly engineering both the chromophore pocket and surface environment of fluorescent proteins. We propose to generate targeted libraries of these proteins express the libraries in mammalian cells and screen proteins for increased brightness increased photostability and decreased conversion to ""dark states"" using a novel microfluidic cell sorter that we recently implemented. Moreover we will conduct multi-parameter screens in order to identify mutations that enhance multiple photophysical properties (for example brightness and photostability) and combine synergistically to improve signal output substantially. This information is crucial as protein engineering efforts based on a single selection scheme typically optimize one property at the expense of another leading to only modest gains in signal output. Our goal is to connect sequence diversity to functional diversity in order to provide insight into the molecular control of photophysical properties in the fluorescent proteins. This information will not only be used in future protein design efforts but will help us define the maximum signal output obtainable from fluorescent proteins. The proposed research has 3 Specific Aims: (1) To increase signal 20-fold with multi-phase screen that probes dark-state relaxation rate; (2) To increase photostability of red fluorescent proteins by at least 7-fold with screen that probes photobleaching; (3) To identify combinations of mutations that yield synergistic effects on photophysical properties. This will enable us to combine enhancements identified in aim 1 and 2 with improvements in brightness to yield an 80- fold increase in signal output. We have chosen to focus on red fluorescent proteins because these have the greatest potential for impacting single molecule cellular imaging. The development of new fluorescent proteins with substantial increases in signal output will dramatically expand our ability to visualize and probe the inner workings of living cells. These imaging tools will impact public health by providing valuable insight into basic biology and mechanisms of disease progression.      ","319932",

However conventional antibodies have several limitations that drastically limit their utility. Tissue must be fixed and permeabilized prior to staining and often the overlapping expression patterns of adjacent neurons are difficult to interpret because of the lack of contextual information. For these reasons the precise subcellular localization patterns in vivo of the majority of neuronal proteins have not been well characterized. The purpose of the studies proposed in this grant is to develop genetically encoded probes that will allow the subcellular localization of neuronal proteins to be mapped in vivo and in real time with high fidelity. These probes consist of genetically encoded aptamers (intrabodies) that bind to endogenous neuronal proteins and are generated using the mRNA display system. Three different types of intrabodies will be generated: 1. Binders to individual cytoskeletal proteins that mark neuronal structures such as pre- and postsynaptic sites. 2. Binders to transmembrane proteins. These intrabodies will be modified to enable them to label either total protein or only protein that is present on the plasma membrane of the cell. 3. Binders to activated G-proteins. Intrabodies will be used to attach three types of molecules to endogenous target proteins: 1. Fluorescent molecules that can be used to report the localization of the protein. 2. proteins for measuring Ca++ concentration in the region around the protein. 3. proteins that are activated by light to produce depolarizing currents. Subcellular trafficking of proteins is crucial to virtually all neuronal functions including establishment of synaptic connections axon guidance and synaptic plasticity. Disruption of protein trafficking has been linked to such diseases as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Protein trafficking also plays a critical role in drug addiction. Intrabodies generated through RNA display will provide tools to map the subcellular localization of endogenous proteins with high fidelity in vivo and in real time which is not possible with current technology.      ","301550",

We believe that nurses play a key role in the implementation of such practices especially practices aimed at preventing healthcare-associated infection. Catheter-related urinary tract infection} the most frequent healthcare-associated infection in the United States} is a costly and potentially lethal condition. The state of Michigan is initiating an ambitious patient safety project to ameliorate the burden of disease associated with indwelling catheterization. The overarching objective of this research is to identify and develop strategies to optimize the implementation of key practices in the field of patient safety and healthcare-associated infection prevention. This study has three aims: 1) To describe the adoption and implementation of a Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection Prevention Bundle (Bladder Bundle) as part of a Michigan state-wide patient safety initiative and assess patient outcomes such as catheter utilization and infection rates; 2) To identify and compare the barriers to and facilitators of implementing the Bladder Bundle across a diverse group of hospitals; and 3) To develop and evaluate strategies to facilitate implementation of the Bladder Bundle and assess patient outcomes including catheter utilization discontinuation re-insertion and infection rates. This investigation includes the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team that has already worked successfully together on a prior study to conduct this timely and innovative patient safety project. For the first aim we will use survey methods to describe the diffusion adoption and implementation of the Bladder Bundle and key patient outcomes. For the second aim we will use primarily qualitative methods consisting of both phone interviews and site visits. This approach will allow us to examine in greater depth complex organizational factors that serve as either facilitators or barriers to implementing the Bladder Bundle. We will also develop implementation strategies and tools that will then be evaluated in collaboration with three hospitals that are in the process of implementing the Bladder Bundle. For the third aim we propose to collect qualitative data before during and after the implementation of the intervention in order to conduct a formative evaluation including an evaluation of implementation process attainment and sustainability. We will also collect quantitative data on patient outcomes such as catheter use discontinuation and infection rates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Catheter-related urinary tract infection is a common costly and potentially lethal condition. The purpose of this research is to develop methods to help prevent catheter-related urinary tract infection. Our study will also provide insight on how to prevent other healthcare-associated infections thereby creating a safer healthcare system.        ","434224",

The consequences of that decision for the patient are significant whether the recommendation is for surgical or non-surgical treatment. If the spine is deemed unstable and at risk for fracture then the patient will undergo a major spinal operation and will often spend much of their remaining life recuperating from it. Conversely the patient whose spine is deemed stable and receives non-surgical treatment risks fracture and possible paralysis if the stability analysis was incorrect. In addition the metastatic disease usually progresses and the stability analysis must be repeated at intervals throughout the disease course. The spinal stability decision is empirical and can be inaccurate even when done by experienced spinal clinicians. This proposal addresses both the stability decision and for those patients deemed at risk for fracture the nature of the treatment. Aim 1 describes the development of an automated program that analyzes spinal computerized tomography scans and calculates the residual load carrying capacity of the affected vertebra. Aim 2 optimizes novel injectable materials to restore the load carrying capacity of the vertebra in a minimally invasive manner thus decreasing time in recovery and rehabilitation from major spine surgery. Successful achievement of this aim would offer an alternative to open surgery for many of these patients thus decreasing their rehabilitation time and increasing their family time. Aim 3 addresses validation of both the automated spinal stability analysis and the minimally invasive spinal reconstruction. These in vitro and in vivo Aim 3 preclinical validation studies are requisite steps to position both the Aim 1 automated diagnostic methodology and the Aim 2 minimally invasive surgical treatment methodology closer to the goal of translation to clinical practice.    Public Health Relevance Statement (provided by applicant): The computerized spinal stability assessment for patients who have cancer that has spread to their spine will offer more accurate diagnosis of the need for spine surgery to the patients and with a much greater likelihood that the patients and their families can get the evaluation done near their home saving them time expense and inconvenience. The recommendation for non-surgical treatment will be made with increased assurance that the risk of a spine fracture is low. Those patients who do need surgery will often chose minimally invasive surgical techniques that will shorten their hospital stay and allow them to return home to their families.      ","423592",

Violence is a health disparity issue that disproportionately affects and is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among Latino youth in the United States. Latino youth in alternative schools are at high risk for becoming both the victims and perpetrators of violence. In this study Familias SUAVE (Families on the Southside United Against a Violent Environment) will implement and evaluate the effectiveness of two culturally appropriate programs El Joven Noble and Cara y Coraz}n. The combination of these two programs represents a powerful multilevel violence prevention strategy that involves the individual male and female peers family members and positive community role models. Using Gendered Social Bond Theory as a conceptual framework El Joven Noble and Cara y Coraz}n is used to foster the development of a social bond to a gender-equitable and non-violent belief system. This proposal incorporates the essential elements and strengths of a community controlled model of community-based participatory research (CBPR). Community members that have been personally affected by violence have and will continue to be full participants in each phase of the work. Our goal is to advance self-governance throughout the project. Community members will implement the intervention collect evaluation data and disseminate results. In addition they will develop their capacity in data management and statistical analysis. The study will use a prospective intervention and control group design. 480 6th-9th grade students attending school at an alternative school will participate in either a violence intervention group or a health career promotion control group. Participants will complete a baseline survey upon enrollment in the study and follow up mail surveys will be conducted at 3 and 9 months post enrollment. Differences in behaviors and attitudes related to youth school and intimate partner violence will be examined between participants in the intervention and control group. Project Narrative Violence significantly and negatively impacts the health and well-being of Americans in urban communities throughout the United States. This project is relevant to the field of public health because it is aimed at preventing the perpetration of youth violence school violence and intimate partner violence. If found to be effective El Joven Noble in combination with Cara y Corazn will be a powerful multi-level strategy for use with high-risk youth enrolled in alternative school settings.

Advantages offered by the use of umbilical cord blood grafts over other sources include the possibility of non-invasive procurement more rapid availability without the need for the more prolonged process of screening and obtaining stem cells from an unrelated donor and the apparently greater tolerance for incompletely HLA-matched products. These advantages are paramount for recipients in underrepresented minority groups for whom the prospect of locating a MUD registry donor remains relatively diminished. Unfortunately infection is the major cause of early mortality after CBT and occurs primarily due to delayed T cell immune reconstitution. To develop approaches to actively intervene to improve T cell recovery it is crucial to systematically study the correlates of T cell immune recovery in the context of novel clinical CBT trials. We hypothesize that the recipient thymus contributes to the recovery of functional antigen-specific T cell responses after CBT and that variability in the ability to recovery thymopoiesis after CBT will predict the likelihood of functional T cell recovery. Additionally we predict that host and/or clinical factors including age and conditioning regimen will be important factors in governing the recovery of thymopoiesis. We further hypothesize that thymopoiesis may be necessary to facilitate the recovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and that robust Treg recovery is protective for the development of chronic GVHD. Finally we hypothesize that graft manipulation strategies including ex vivo expansion and the infusion of multiple units will influence both thymopoetic recovery and the recovery of peripheral T cells including antigen-specific memory cells and Tregs. We will test these hypotheses in the following specific Aims: 1. To examine the importance of host factors and conditioning regimen on the recovery of a diverse and functional T cell repertoire after CBT in children and adults. 2. To determine how regulatory T cell recovery is influenced by thymopoiesis and whether regulatory T cells influence the occurrence of chronic GVHD in CBT recipients. 3. To define how donor graft manipulations that increase infused CBT stem cell numbers influence the recovery of thymopoiesis and T cell immune recovery. For many patients with high-risk or relapsed hematological malignancies and other diseases of children including inherited metabolic disorders allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only curative treatment option. For individuals lacking a suitable immunologically matched family or registry donor umbilical cord blood (CB) represents an important source of stem cells that can be used to regenerate normal blood cell production in transplant recipients. Unfortunately the leading cause of mortality after CB transplantation is infection caused by poor T cell recovery. In this proposal we will perform ancillary studies that will dissect the determinants and correlates of protective immune recovery in the setting of novel clinical approaches being applied to improve CB transplant outcomes. The impact of both donor graft and host factors will be studied to help define subpopulations at greatest risk for mortality and to design safer and more curative approaches for the future.

However the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-promoting effects of chronic inflammation remain enigmatic. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms through which chronic inflammation promotes lung cancer. The asbestos model of lung injury is well established in our laboratory and it serves as a paradigm for inducing the initial events that lead to carcinogenesis. Cigarette smoke is a potent inducer of inflammation in the lung and increases the oncogenic potential of asbestos by unknown mechanisms. Bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) have been identified as the putative cells of origin in lung adenocarcinoma. The anatomic location of the BASC niche precisely coincides with asbestos-induced lesion development. Accordingly the central hypothesis of this proposal is that cigarette smoke augments the pro-neoplastic effects of asbestos and that inhibition of the p53 tumor suppressor protein enhances inflammation and dysregulates proliferation of BASCs thereby increasing the synergistic effects of asbestos and cigarette smoke in lung tumorigenesis. To directly test our hypothesis we will use two independent but complementary approaches that utilize in vivo mouse models of lung cancer and in vitro cell culture of BASCs. First we will determine lung tumorigenesis in wild-type and p53R172H (a dominant negative mutant) knockin mice after inhalation exposure to asbestos and cigarette smoke. Second we will measure activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of cell proliferation at sites of lesion development in wild-type and p53R172H knockin mice exposed to asbestos and cigarette smoke. Third we will determine inflammatory mediator-dependent mechanisms of bronchioalveolar stem cell proliferation. Finally we will reduce inflammation and evaluate tumorigenesis induced by cigarette smoke and asbestos. These studies will determine whether BASCs are the targets of the oncogenic effects of chronic inflammation induced by mixed asbestos- cigarette smoke inhalation exposures and further characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms with an emphasis on transcriptional programming governed by crosstalk between inflammatory signals and p53. Determining the role of chronic inflammation in the acquisition of a malignant phenotype by a lung stem cell may provide novel insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of lung cancer.      ","285745",

Many studies have demonstrated that inflammatory leukocytes promote epithelial cancer by providing soluble growth and survival factors to initiated cells and contribute to tissue remodeling and angiogenesis via synthesis of extracellular proteases; thus physiological processes necessary for tumor development (enhanced cell survival tissue remodeling and angiogenesis) are regulated in part by leukocytes and the soluble mediators they deliver. However molecular mechanisms mediating the dialogue between infiltrating immune cells with initiated epithelia are poorly characterized. Moreover the degree to which these interactions alter stem cell niches in neoplastic environments have not been explored. We hypothesize that infiltrating immune cells regulate niche autonomy of putative lung cancer stem cells through activation of Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling cascades in initiated lung epithelia; thus the goals of this project are to define the lineages of functionally significant immune cells that potentiate cancer development in lung determine which of these regulate Wnt and Shh signaling in lung epithelia and determine if in so doing they confer stem cell niche autonomy to initiated epithelial cells and therefore enhance tumorigenic potential. To assess our hypothesis we propose to 1) define the profile of immune cells associated with human and mouse lung carcinogenesis and determine how these correlate with presence of CD133+ cells and activation of Wnt and Shh signaling cascades 2) define functional significance of recruited immune cells as regulators of Wnt and Shh signaling during lung carcinogenesis and 3) Define the functional significance of immune cells as regulators of Wnt and Shh signaling and their combined effects on putative lung cancer stem cells.      ","293391",

The attack frequency ranges from a few in a lifetime to several per week (median: 1.5 attacks/month). Evidence is accumulating that migraine attacks might also permanently affect the brain. Clinic-based studies (i.e. primarily including severely affected patients) suggest that migraine is an independent risk factor for clinical stroke magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible cerebral white matter lesions (WML) mild cognitive impairment and cerebellar dysfunction. Our group showed in the cross-sectional population-based  CAMERA  MRI study that migraine cases from the general population are at increased risk of WML and cerebellar infarct-like lesions. Most importantly the risk increased with increasing attack frequency in particular in females and migraineurs with aura. This would suggest that recurrent migraine attacks might indeed progressively affect the brain in subgroups of patients. Such a relationship however needs to be demonstrated in a longitudinal design. We propose to rescan and re-evaluate the entire  CAMERA  case and control sample (n=435) that was originally scanned in 1999 and 2000. This unique 8-9 year follow-up study of brain MRI and clinical characteristics will be based on a sample of 295 migraine cases and 140 non-migraine controls from the general population. In addition because of the limited number of cases with >2 attacks/month in the  CAMERA  study we will include a second study population with patients (n=150) suffering from >2 migraine with aura attacks/month. Because of the high prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in migraine with aura inclusion of these patients would also allow for a better assessment of the contribution of PFO to migraine- related brain lesions. In the CAMERA population we will assess onset and progression of brain lesions and correlate these findings with gender migraine characteristics (aura attack frequency use of migraine medication) and presence of PFO. In addition we will evaluate the presence of cognitive impairment and cerebellar dysfunction and correlate these findings with the MRI findings. In the second study population we will assess the effect on MRI brain lesion load of a very high number of attacks with aura and the contribution of the presence of PFO. The ultimate goal of our study is to answer the important healthcare question whether recurring migraine attacks may cause functionally relevant brain lesions which could potentially be prevented by a more aggressive preventative treatment of migraine. Relevance Migraine is a highly prevalent brain disorder clinically primarily characterized by attacks of headache and associated symptoms which are believed to be harmless to the brain. Triggered by preliminary evidence we propose to assess whether recurring migraine attacks might permanently and progressively affect the brain and whether this relates to brain dysfunction. If confirmed this would call for an earlier and more aggressive prophylactic treatment of migraine to prevent attacks and related brain damage.      ","196260",

This will be accomplished by linking systematic experiments to quantitative analysis. Stochastic models of yeast kinetochores and their ten known MAPs and motors will be generated using automated procedures and then calibrated to live-cell data using the method of indirect inference. Chromosome segregation is the process by which replicated DNA molecules are pulled into daughter cells by attaching to and moving along the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Chromosome-microtubule attachment is mediated by kinetochores multi-component protein complexes that form on centromeric DNA. S. cerevisiae is an attractive organism in which to study kinetochores because it contains the simplest of all known centromeres and because its molecular genetics is uniquely powerful. The conservation of kinetochore proteins from yeast to man suggests that principles learned from the study of simpler structures in yeast will be directly applicable to higher cells and to the genomic instability which aberrant kinetochore function causes. Aim 1: For kinetochore gene mutations autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling and fuzzy clustering will quantify phenotypic similarity and heterogeneity. Aim 2: The role of tension in controlling kinetochore-microtubule interaction will be explored genetically and with ARMA having an input for exogenous variables (ARMAX) Aim 3: Stochastic models of kinetochores based on biophysical prior knowledge will be evaluated and calibrated to single-cell data using indirect inference and ARMA descriptors as a source of auxiliary parameters.We propose to study the cellular machinery responsible for dividing chromosomes the DNA and protein structures that encode and preserve the genomel into two equal sets upon cell division. Normally this process of ""segregation"" is very accurate but it goes awry in cancer and gives rise to the genetic plasticity that makes long-term treatment of cancer problematic.        ","459667",

The existence of multiple oscillators had been postulated for decades as a basis for the desynchrony of overt circadian rhythms that occurs during shift work jet lag and depression. These extra-SCN oscillators have been studied mainly in vitro using tissues explanted from males; thus the physiological role of these oscillators is not yet known especially in females. We propose to investigate the regulation of circadian rhythms in clock gene expression in vivo in female neuroendocrine cells the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons because they have an easily measured physiologically important output the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Although the LH surge depends on the SCN the GnRH neurons themselves express the circadian clock gene Per1. Furthermore immortalized GnRH neurons GT1-7 cells exhibit circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in vitro. Disruption of these molecular circadian rhythms in GT1-7 cells alters their pattern of GnRH secretion suggesting that molecular circadian clocks are necessary for the  secretory function of GnRH neurons. This proposal aims to study the regulation and function of a circadian molecular oscillation in native GnRH neurons in female hamsters. The specific aims are to investigate:    Aim 1) the role of circadian phase advances in control of the LH surge Aim 2) the role of SCN GABA-A receptors in control of the LH surge Aim 3) the role of circadian clock genes in the SCN in control of the LH surge Aim 4) the role of vasopressin as an output signal from the SCN regulating GnRH neurons and Aim 5) the expression of PER1 in endogenous GnRH neurons and its role in the LH surge. These studies will exploit the GnRH neurons as a model system with an essential physiological role and easily measured output in order to elucidate the regulation and function of an extra-SCN brain oscillator in vivo.     Understanding multiple oscillators is important for the amelioration of internal desynchrony of circadian rhythms that occurs during shift work and jet lag. Also by studying females the findings of this project may be relevant to the disruptions in circadian hormone rhythms seen in women with affective disorders.This project seeks to understand the regulation and interaction of multiple circadian oscillators that regulate circadian neuroendocrine rhythms. Understanding multiple circadian oscillators is important for amelioration of circadian rhythms desynchrony which occurs during shift work jet lag aging and depression and increases the risk of obesity cardiovascular disease cognitive deficits and depression.    Because this project focuses on females the findings will also be relevant to disruptions in circadian hormone rhythms seen in women with affective disorders such as pre-menstrual dysphoric syndrome post-partum depression and postmenopausal depression.      ","323903",

Prostate cancer is dependent on androgen acting through the androgen receptor (AR) for growth and survival and androgen ablation has been used for treatment of prostate cancer. Despite an initially favorable response hormone ablation therapy eventually fails and the cancer progresses to an incurable metastatic disease. Epidemiological data regarding prostate cancer genetics indicate roles of AR mutation as well as AR poly-glutamine (poly-Q) polymorphism in susceptibility to prostate cancer development and response to therapy. The overall objective of this proposal is to create mouse prostate cancer models for studying the role of the AR in prostatic cancer development and metastasis. Using the Cre-loxP conditional gene knockout technology several derivatives of TRAMP or PTEN-deficient mouse prostate cancer models with cell type-specific AR knockout (ARKO) (post-puberty epithelial fibroblast- and smooth muscle cell-specific ARKO) replacement of prostatic epithelial AR with AR(T857A) [murine equivalent of human AR(T877A)] mutant will be generated for in vivo study of the roles of the AR in prostate stromal cells or epithelial cells the AR(T877A) mutation in prostate cancer initiation progression or metastasis. Prostate tumor initiation progression and/or metastasis in these models will be examined and compared with their littermates expressing wild type AR through histological analyses immunohistochemical determination of various cellular markers biochemical determination of the expression levels of tumor metastasis related genes and proteins and analysis of invasive properties of their metastatic tumor. Through the differences in these parameters between the various ARKO or AR (T857A) mice and their wild type littermates the role of the AR in each specific cell type and the AR(T877A) mutation in prostate carcinogenesis will be delineated. Information obtained from these studies not only will provide better understanding of the roles of the AR in prostate carcinogenesis but also will be useful for designing new treatment regimen for prostate cancer in hormone refractory state. In addition these models may be useful for testing new drugs for prostate cancer therapy. Project Narrative: New Mice Models for Studies of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer     We will generate various mouse models that lack the androgen receptor in individual cells of the prostate and study their influence on prostate cancer progression. Information obtained from our studies of the differences between these mice models will lead to our understanding some roles of the androgen receptor in the development of prostate cancer and also will be useful for designing new treatments for prostate cancer. In addition these mice models may be useful for testing new drugs and treatments for prostate cancer therapy which might eventually be used in humans.        ","319550",

The presence of lymph node metastasis in the neck is an important prognostic factor and crucial in making clinical decisions regarding postoperative treatments and follow ups. However the current clinical diagnosis of lymph node metastasis for early stage (T1-T2) oral tongue cancer is not ideal. Occult nodal metastasis can be expected in over 30% of patients with T1 and T2 tongue cancers and clinically metastasis negative (N0) necks. It is critically important to identify those cancers with metastasis potential for more aggressive therapy. The identification of molecular markers associated with the metastasis and the development of a prediction model based on these markers will improve clinical treatment decisions in the management of this dreadful cancer and would help to facilitate the development of therapeutic interventions for oral tongue SCC patients. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that signature genomic and expressional alternations exist in oral tongue cancer that distinguish tumors that metastasize from those that do not. Patient resources are in place to permit genomic and expressional studies including early stage (T1-T2) oral tongue cancer patients with known metastasis outcome (Aim 1). Bioinformatics and biocomputational expertise are in place to harness diagnostic molecular determinants in the metastatic oral tongue cancers and to build molecular classification model for tongue cancer metastasis (CMTCM) (Aim 2). Aim 3 is to test the classification models in a multi-center setting to evaluate the clinical utility of this classification/prediction models for oral tongue cancer metastasis. The overarching aim of the proposal is to translate genome-wide discoveries into a predictive model that can forecast metastatic potential of early stage oral tongue SCC and thus improve clinical treatment decisions in the management of oral tongue cancer. Relevance to Public Health (Project Narrative): This research project will lead to the discovery of biomarkers that can be used for the detection of oral tongue cancer metastasis which will improve the management and treatment of oral tongue cancer patients.      ","408434",

Human CBS is a remarkable enzyme that requires three different cofactors: S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) heme and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Enzyme activity is regulated by AdoMet which binds to the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain and opens the active site. The reaction chemistry of CBS is attributed solely to the PLP. The heme is essential for maximal enzyme activity but its precise role is as yet unclear. Positioned at a branch point in sulfur metabolism CBS is the only enzyme that irreversibly removes toxic homocysteine from the body. A defect in the CBS protein in humans is the most common cause of homocystinuria an inherited metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine and decreased levels of cysteine and glutathione   and a profoundly enhanced risk of thromboembolism and stroke. More than one hundred pathological variants of CBS are known in homocystinuric patients many of which cluster in the AdoMet-associated and heme-associated regions of the protein.     We will investigate the biochemical consequences of the absence of heme and of select mutations in the AdoMet- and heme-binding regions of CBS in order to determine how the three cofactors interact in the physiological function of the enzyme. This project is an integrated collaborative effort between the Kraus lab with expertise in the physiology and molecular genetics of homocysteine metabolism and the Burstyn lab with expertise in heme protein structure and function. To accomplish our goal we will combine physiological biochemical and biophysical methods to understand the role of heme in CBS.   The Specific Aims for the continuation of this project are: 1) to test the hypothesis that the heme is critical for AdoMet regulation and functional stability of the human CBS protein 2) to test the hypothesis that impaired AdoMet response correlates with aberrant behavior of heme or PLP and 3) to test the hypothesis that the CBS heme stabilizes the active site PLP and that disruption of this interaction compromises CBS function.NARRATIVE Some people have errors in the gene for an important protein named CBS whose job is to remove the molecule homocysteine from blood. These people are very likely to get blood clots or have strokes because their CBS protein does not work properly and their homocysteine levels are too high.  This project looks at the errors in the CBS protein and tries to learn from those errors how the protein normally works.      ","384079",

The first three studies were highly productive demonstrating 1) continuity of the pathophysiology of depression in the pediatric age group 2) efficacy of fluoxetine over placebo in pediatric depression and most recently 3) continued use of fluoxetine beyond acute treatment reduces relapse rates in this population. However there continue to be major deficits in the research of pediatric depression treatment. Despite several positive RCTs in both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy with relatively strong response rates (55-65%) remission rates (being ""well"") remain quite low (30-40%). Furthermore early onset depression is often chronic leading to high rates of relapse. In our recently completed continuation study even with continued treatment of fluoxetine 42% relapsed with 22% experiencing a complete relapse of depression (CDRS-R =40 with 2 weeks of clinical deterioration). Residual symptoms were associated with higher relapse rates especially in fluoxetine-treated patients. Although continued medication reduces relapse rates other continuation phase treatments are needed with particular emphasis on increasing remission and shortening the time to remission. Adult research suggests that adding cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following antidepressant treatment response reduces residual symptoms (which have been associated with lowering relapse rates) and reduces relapse rates. Utilizing the R34 mechanism the investigators have developed a CBT treatment intervention which focuses on improving residual symptoms and teaching wellness skills to youth who have responded to an antidepressant (R34 MH72737 ""Continuation Phase CBT for Youth with MDD; PI: Kennard). We propose to determine if adding psychotherapy (CBT) following antidepressant response will improve remission rates and time to remission as well as reduce relapse rates in children and adolescents compared to continued medication management. One hundred forty two youth (ages 7-18) with MDD who respond to 6 weeks of fluoxetine will be randomized to continued medication management alone (MM) or a sequential treatment strategy (STS) of medication management plus relapse prevention CBT (RP- CBT) for 6 months. Following randomization all subjects will be evaluated every six weeks by an independent evaluator for the 6 month continuation phase. Remission is defined as CDRS-R total score =28. Relapse is defined as 1) CDRS-R score =40 with a history of 2 weeks of clinical deterioration or 2) CDRS-R<40 but with significant clinical deterioration. All subjects will be evaluated every 6 months for 1 year after completion of the continuation phase. Depression in youth is an underdiagnosed and undertreated illness which can lead to long-term deficits in school family and overall functioning. Many pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions are available for this disorder; however to date few treatments have been effective in treating youth to remission or symptom free status which is important as partial remission is related to relapse of depressive symptoms. The proposed project would test a treatment strategy combining medication treatment with fluoxetine and a new Relapse Prevention Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (RP-CBT) to maximize the benefits of both treatments to result in higher remission rates and reduced relapse rates.      ","570909",

Real time PCR of genes within this region indicated that EVI1 (ecotropic viral integration site-1) and an intergenic MDS1/EVI1 fusion transcript were the most highly amplified transcripts within this region. Moreover EVI1 is aberrantly spliced (Del190-515) in >90% of tumors. MDS1/EVI1 and EVI1 alter proliferation motility senescence and signaling in ovarian epithelial cells. Further increases in MDS1/EVI1 levels are associated with a good prognosis while EVI1Del190-515 was associated with a poor outcome. Thus our data suggest that EVI1 MDS1/EVI1 and its splice forms play distinct roles during tumor initiation and progression depending on the cellular context. Patient outcome is likely dependent on the relative levels of the EVI1 splice variants. EVI1 has recently been implicated in cell survival and inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF beta TGF?) signaling by increasing PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) activity. Thus we will test the hypothesis that the relative expression of the EVI1 proto-oncogene and its aberrantly spliced forms contributes to ovarian cancer initiation progression and drug responsiveness through differential effects on PI3K and TGF? signaling. We will test this hypothesis through the following three aims:     1) We will determine whether overexpression of aberrantly spliced forms of the proto-oncogene EVI1 contributes to ovarian cancer initiation progression and drug responsiveness.     2) We will determine whether EVI1 and its splice variants mediate different cellular effects through regulating the PI3K and TGF? signaling pathways.     3) We will test the hypothesis that splice variants of EVI1 predicts patient outcomes.      ","327989",

For many years there has been an active search to find a safe and effective vaccine to prevent primary RSV infection in naWve infants although progress in RSV vaccine development has been hampered by the unusual biology of the virus as well as the legacy of vaccine-enhanced illness during trials of a formalin-inactivated whole virus vaccine preparation in the mid 1960's. The problem of establishing RSV immunity is complicated by the fact that while the presence of neutralizing antibody is generally protective against pulmonary infection re-infection of the upper airway throughout life is the rule. The observation that adaptive immune response fails to protect the upper airway is well established but not well understood. While upper airway disease is never life threatening it is nonetheless a very important health problem as RSV has been shown to be the predominant viral pathogen predisposing children to bacterial otitis media (OM). Since RSV is a major trigger for OM and clinical data show frequent reinfection in young children we hypothesize that development of an effective vaccine targeting RSV infection will have a significant impact on the occurrence of OM. In the first cycle of this grant we have developed both murine and chinchilla models of RSV upper airway infection and have used these to test a new RSV vaccine candidate: a recombinant Newcastle disease virus vector expressing the RSV F protein. We have found that mucosal priming with this construct is protective in both rodent models and now wish to explore both the mechanism of this protection as well as the ability of this vaccine to inhibit bacterial OM following viral and bacterial co- infection. Our specific aims are these: 1) Determine whether immunization against RSV can protect against bacterial co-infection in the chinchilla model; 2) Define the correlates of upper airway protection; and 3) Determine the mechanisms by which RSV infection enhances host susceptibility of bacterial OM.     Recent studies have found that otitis media or ear infections in babies and young children are always caused by infection with both a viral and a bacterial organism. The bacteria that cause ear infections normally live in the nose and are not a problem until the child catches a cold. Once the child has a virus infection the host defenses are damaged and normally harmless bacteria then cause disease. There is one cold virus called RSV which infects children over and over and is found in the majority of children with ear infections. Our group has found a new vaccine against this virus and want to test whether immunity to RSV can protect against the process that causes bacterial ear infections.            ","428678",

PtdIns(45)P2 directly binds and regulates activity of many proteins and at least three major second messengers are produced in a single step from this minor membrane phospholipid. The inositol lipid-specific phospholipase C isozymes integrate signals from multiple upstream G protein regulators and act as highly organized but poorly understood signaling nodes central to the action of many growth factors hormones neurotransmitters and other stimuli. Recent work from our laboratories has led to increased appreciation of multiple modes of regulation of inositol lipid signaling by Rac Rho and heterotrimeric G proteins. Moreover our structures of PLC-22 and of PLC-22 in GTP-dependent complex with Rac1 provide the first mechanistic snapshots of PLC isozymes past the original structure of PLC-4 solved a decade ago. This progress and recent success in producing stable complexes of G1q and PLC-2 isozymes has placed us in position to design experiments that will provide understanding of G protein-mediated regulation of the catalytic activity of PLC isozymes in structurally and mechanistically unambiguous terms. We propose three specific aims to reach this goal: Specific Aim 1. To delineate the interface and mechanism through which GTP-bound Rho binds PLC-5 and cooperates with Ras in activation of this novel PLC isozyme. Specific Aim 2. To define the structural basis of interaction of G1q with the carboxy-terminus of PLC-2 isozymes and to delineate the mechanism through which this interaction stimulates PLC activity. Specific Aim 3. To determine the mechanism whereby an auto-inhibiting occlusion of the active site by a catalytic domain insert is relieved during interfacial activation of PLC isozymes at phosphoinositide-containing membranes.       ","368358",

Only one of these gene families CYP51 is found in all biological kingdoms bacteria to humans. CYP51 catalyzes an essential step in sterol biosynthesis the sterol 141-demethylation reaction which is the first step in the postsqualene portion of the pathway. This competing renewal will continue studies of CYP51 with a long term goal of developing detailed understanding of inhibition of this important drug target. We will determine the high resolution X-ray structure of this enzyme from different eukaryotes including rat Candida albicans and trypanosomes (T. brucei and T. cruzi). The more than 100 CYP51 sequences known throughout biology contain 29 conserved amino acids the CYP51 signature. When certain of these amino acids are mutated in the soluble form of CYP51 from bacteria (M. tuberculosis) and compared to the same mutation in membrane bound eukaryotic forms (human trypanosomes) significant functional differences are observed. Therefore we believe that 3D structure including functional conformational dynamics in the prokaryotic CYP51 may be quite different from those in eukaryotic forms emphasizing the need to determine eukaryotic CYP51 structure to compare with the bacterial structure leading to better understanding of the general principles of CYP51 conservation. CYP51 is a well known drug target for pathogenic yeast/fungal infections and azole CYP51 inhibitors are used to treat such infections. However it is challenging to develop drugs which are specific for the pathogen and do not target host (human) P450s. We will investigate two types of inhibitors for their effectiveness in inhibition of CYP51 from different organisms particularly those from trypanosomes. Both substrate-based and nitrogen-based inhibitors will be examined because they bind differently in the P450 active site region. Also we will carry out high throughput screening of a 160000 chemical library to search for tight binding molecules which might also be inhibitors of CYP51. Having identified potent inhibitors in vitro we will co-crystallize them with CYP51 orthologs (emphasis on trypanosomal forms) in order to understand in detail the structural basis of inhibition. This study will provide insight into how the CYP51 protein structure influences tight binding of both types of inhibitors and will suggest what structural features of catalytic inhibitors of CYP51 are most important for this inhibition process. We will also study the effect of the most potent inhibitors in cellular forms of trypanosomes and subsequently in well established mouse models for T. cruzi infection. These studies will lead to a detailed understanding of the structure/function relationship of this essential P450 and also will establish a detailed paradigm for discovery of specific drugs for the infectious protozoa T. brucei and T. cruzi and perhaps information on potential lead compounds for treatment of such infections. It can be expected that a paradigm for development of specific inhibitors of sterol 141-demethylase will arise from these studies. These inhibitors will be specific for the enzymes in pathogenic protozoa such as trypansomes and have little or no effect on the host (human) enzyme. As a result of this inhibition the protozoa will not be able to synthesize sterols and can not survive.      ","345921",

Adolescence is a development period of identity search and construction; and for minority youth this identity may be particularly complex given the meaning and significance that United States society places on ethnicity. While many theorists have discussed the fluidity of ethnic identity there is surprisingly little empirical support and even less longitudinal research. Incorporating developmental and social psychological theories we take a person by situation approach to our study by examining the fluidity of ethnic identity as youths move through their natural environments and settings. As such the proposed research examines the impact of context at a global and immediate level on the fluidity of ethnic identity salience. Since youths bring certain personal characteristics (e.g. stable ethnic identity) into each setting it is also important to examine the unique experiences of ethnic identity salience for the same individual across different contexts as well as for different individuals in the same contexts. To this end we employ a combination of experience sampling daily diary and survey methods to measure ethnic identity at more than on level. As well the literature on ethnic identity suggests that it is related to how youths feel about themselves; therefore this study will examine how the fluidity of ethnic identity salience is associated with the fluidity of psychological feelings across days and situations. Finally we will examine these associations over a three-year period in order to examine how everyday experiences impact the development and maintenance of stable ethnic identity over time. Developmental theorists have suggested that it is youths repeated experience in settings that culminate over time to influence the development and maintenance of more stable traits; we will test this theory by examining ethnic identity. We believe that this project is of particular relevance to understanding the everyday experiences of minority youth in the United States and how these experiences shape their psychological adjustment (e.g. depression anxiety) and feelings of self-worth (e.g. self-esteem) over time. By including African Asian and Latino American youth we will be able to examine differences between youths in each of these groups as well as commonalities they share as minorities.      ","331667",

Although this work has been successful to prevent ischemic myocardial damage acutely and the development of an ischemic myopathy chronically we need to identify a PC capable of restoring the integrity of injured coronary vessels and/or creating de novo conductive coronary arteries and their distal branches. Theoretically in a manner comparable to hematopoietic stem cells that can repopulate and completely reconstitute the ablated bone marrow PCs may possess the inherent ability to rebuild the damaged myocardium and convert a severely diseased heart into a physiologically functional heart. Based on this premise this renewal application will test whether resident PCs conform to a non-uniform cell pool which sustains myocardial homeostasis through the activation and commitment of distinct cell classes devoted respectively to the replacement of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in coronary vessels and cardiomyocytes. The hypothesis to be tested is that vascular niches are present within the wall of the coronary circulation and vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) are stored within vascular niches. VPCs are viewed as a subset of the PC pool which possesses specialized functions predominantly devoted to the turnover of SMCs and ECs and vasculogenesis. For this purpose we need profound understanding of the biology of cardiac PCs and must determine whether this PC pool includes subsets which have powerful vasculogenic properties. Identification of a coronary VPC able to differentiate predominantly into SMCs and ECs would suggest that the heart possesses the inherent ability to create the various portions of the coronary circulation. However a critical issue concerns the origin of VPCs and the mechanisms involved in the preservation of the VPC compartment in the coronary circulation. This may be accomplished by migration of primitive cells from the bone marrow to the vessel wall asymmetric and symmetric division of resident VPCs within the vascular niches or both. Therefore the long-term objective of this proposal is the acquisition of fundamental knowledge on the function of VPCs and to determine whether niche homeostasis is regulated by extrinsic and/or intrinsic cellular processes. The identity of VPCs and the mechanisms involved in the activation and differentiation of this PC class into SMCs and ECs will be evaluated by a combination of cellular and molecular approaches together with in vivo experimentation to document its efficacy in the restoration of the integrity of the coronary vasculature and its regeneration.

If this were possible cell therapy may be employed to interfere with ischemic injury the prevailing cause of human heart failure and prevention may supersede the need for myocardial regeneration.         ","556240",

Such information is integral to the eventual development of specific antiviral agents that could be used to abrogate coronavirus replication. Towards that end we have developed a covariation-based model of the secondary structure of the coronavirus 5' UTR that contains three conserved stem-loop structures SL1 SL2 and SL4. This model has provided the basis for designing experiments and developing hypotheses that will lead to new molecular-level insights into how RNA structure and RNA-protein interactions regulate coronavirus replication. This application focuses on three aspects of our model. In the first aim we will investigate our hypothesis that SL1 must be a dynamic structure to allow interactions with other RNA sequences and/or replication accessory proteins that ultimately mediate an interaction between the 5' and 3' UTRs in genome circularization. Biochemical biophysical (NMR thermodynamic studies) and reverse genetic approaches will be utilized to determine the stability of SL1 and the requirement for a dynamic SL1 in viral replication. Biochemical studies will be performed to identify proteins that bind to SL1 and their role in circularization of the coronavirus genome. In the second aim we will investigate SL2 a stem-loop that our preliminary studies have indicated adopts an unusual U-turn like structure. We propose to solve the solution structure of SL2 at high resolution using NMR methods and perform a series of reverse genetic studies to test predictions of our structural model in the context of the MHV genome and determine their effects on viral replication. In the third aim we will employ a combination of biophysical and reverse genetic experiments to investigate the interaction of the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein with the transcriptional regulatory sequences in the 5' leader (TRS-L) RNA. We will determine the solution structure of nucleocapsid protein:TRS-L RNA complexes by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Informed by the nucleocapsid protein:TRS-L RNA structure we will perform a series of reverse genetic studies to determine if the TRS:nucleocapsid interaction plays a role in RNA replication subgenomic RNA synthesis and/or translation. The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the detailed structure and function of critical coronavirus cis- acting sequences and interacting proteins and provide mechanistic insights into coronavirus replication.    Coronaviruses are important human and veterinary pathogens with the SARS-coronavirus being the most serious human pathogen. Although the original outbreak of SARS was brought under control this virus is a threat to re-emerge from its zoonotic source. The research proposed in this application will advance our detailed knowledge of coronavirus replication and by doing so lay the basis for future development of additional anti-virals directed against this group of viruses.        ","376661",

In the last granting period we showed that the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase O (PTPRO) is methylated and silenced in preneoplastic nodules and primary hepatomas induced in a rat model. Subsequent study established that PTPRO is a bona fide tumor suppressor. In the present study we will examine whether its promoter methylation can be used as biomarker for liver cancer of specific etiology and its function in liver. We will also explore epigenetic regulation of nutrient gene interaction in hepatocarcinogenesis using methionine adenosytransferase 1a (Mat1a) null (MAT1KO) mice and methyl deficient diet as a model system. Frequent loss of Mat1a in human primary liver tumors results in decreased SAM (cofactor for all methylation reactions) level and correlates with dedifferentiation of hepatocytes. MAT1KO mice exhibit reduced hepatic SAM level and increased susceptibility to hepatic injury upon feeding methyl-deficient diet. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to analyze methylation profile of PTPRO CpG island spanning the promoter and exon1 in a large number of human primary HCCs of different etiology using EpiTyper technology and determine whether methylation of PTPRO in HCCs inversely correlates with its expression. 2) Determine the potential role of PTPRO in regulating invasiveness of HCC cells and their sensitization to drug (doxorubicin 5-Fluorouracil)-induced apoptosis and identify liver-specific substrate(s) of PTPRO by substrate-trapping assay that will unravel potential therapeutic targets for HCC. 3) Investigate liver pathophysiology and susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis of MAT1KO mice on CDAA diet compared to the wild type mice. 4) Compare methylation profile of the liver genome of MAT1KO mice with the wild type mice at early stages of CDAA diet-induced hepatocarcinogenesis confirm differential methylation of the candidate genes and determine whether methylation status of these genes correlates inversely with their expression. It is hoped that this study will provide us with novel insights into (a) role of PTPRO in liver tumorigenesis (b) relationship between dietary methyl deficiency and changes in DNA methylation and expression of genes at early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis (c) role of Mat1a and SAM in induction of liver cancer by the deficient diet and (d) additional molecular targets for early stage diagnosis and epigenetic therapy of HCC. This proposal also fits well with the recent program announcement of multiple institutes on diet epigenetic events and cancer prevention.Liver cancer is the fifth most prevalent cancer in the world and is the third leading cause of cancer-related death with annual date rate exceeding 500000 and is increasing in frequency and mortality (particularly in men) in the United States. The present study will address the role of dietary methyl deficiency in the initiation of liver tumorigenesis. Specifically this study is aimed at (a) elucidation of the role of specific genes that are methylated and silenced at early stages of liver cancer in response to this dietary deficiency and (b) identification of novel molecular targets for early diagnosis and epigenetic therapy of liver cancer.

Two of the most clinically challenging tumors in NF1 are the optic glioma (astrocytoma) and the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Recent studies from our laboratories and others have shown that both NF1- associated optic glioma and MPNST exhibit high levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation and proliferation of Nf1-deficient cells are inhibited by agents that block mTOR activity. Our ability to more effectively treat these tumors is heavily dependent on the identification and preclinical evaluation of new chemotherapeutic compounds that target this important NF1 growth regulatory pathway. The overall objectives of this proposal are to determine how neurofibromin regulates mTOR-pathway-mediated cell growth and to identify new anti-cancer mTOR pathway inhibitory compounds suitable for the treatment of NF1- associated tumors. In this proposal we plan to determine how neurofibromin regulates mTOR pathway activation in vitro and in vivo. Next we propose to determine how neurofibromin-mediated mTOR pathway regulation controls cell growth. Lastly using both a standard luciferase reporter and a recently developed novel mTOR pathway reporter we propose to employ high-throughput chemical library screening to identify new compounds that inhibit mTOR pathway activation and the growth of Nf1-deficient cells. The availability of genetically-engineered mice and human cell lines affords us a unique opportunity for translational research in which basic science discoveries can be evaluated as potential clinical therapies. Based on the recommendations of the recent Banbury conference on ""Barriers and Solutions in the Use of Mouse Models to Develop Therapeutic Strategies for Neurofibromatosis-Associated Tumors"" we plan to use Nf1- deficient astrocytes and Nf1-deficient human MPNST cells as ""filters"" to select mTOR inhibitory agents for future trials that have the greatest likelihood of succeeding in the clinic.       ","341561",

Our hypothesis is that mutations in COL7A1 have broad effects on the structure of cutaneous basement membrane and that critical targets for successful therapy approaches differ for various procollagen VII mutants. We formulated the following Specific Aims: (1) To create a controllable and biologically relevant experimental system to study assembly of the cutaneous basement membrane in the presence of procollagen VII mutants (2) To determine the consequences of suppressed expression of procollagen VII mutants on remodeling of an abnormal cutaneous basement membrane (3) To define targets which have to be reached in cell- based approaches to correct pathological changes in the cutaneous basement membrane caused by mutations in procollagen VII. Due to limits such as ineffective delivery of therapeutic agents to skin approaches to counterbalance pathological effects of mutations in procollagen VII have been tested only in a limited way. Thus we propose that a simple well controlled experimental system is needed to constructively validate prospects and uncover limitations of potential therapy approaches in experimental conditions that simulate fully effective delivery of ""therapeutic agents"". We also postulate that a comprehensive study is required to define skin-specific conditions needed to drive skin harboring a procollagen VII mutant toward remodeling into normal structure in response to cell or gene therapies. We will address this problem by creating a biologically relevant model which will resemble the complexity of skin structure. This model will consist of engineered keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts from Col7a1-null mice which will conditionally express cDNA constructs encoding recombinant procollagen VII mutants analogous to those found in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa patients in addition to recombinant wild type procollagen VII and other skin- specific markers. These cells will be employed to create skin-like constructs in cell culture conditions and in athymic nude mice. Subsequently changes in characteristics of the skin-like constructs preformed in the presence of mutant procollagen VII variants will be studied after switching off expression of mutant collagens or after experiments simulating ""delivery"" of cells expressing wild type procollagen VII. The study we propose here will extend our understanding of the molecular pathomechanisms underlining dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and will provide a basis for developing approaches to treating this disease. Thus the relevance of the proposed study to public health is high. Relevance: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is an incapacitating heritable disease of skin caused by mutations in procollagen VII and there is no effective treatment that could alleviate clinical symptoms associated with this disease. We propose to develop and exploit a relatively uncomplicated experimental model to test approaches to counterbalance pathological symptoms of this disease. Results of our study will establish minimal targets that have to be reached to correct pathological changes in skin caused by mutations in procollagen VII. Thus the relevance of our proposed research for public health is high.      ","339088",

These individuals typically suffer from metabolic syndrome and are at increased risk for atherosclerosis. Diets high in saturated fat lead to arterial plaque formation through binding and uptake of TGRL which penetrate into the vascular wall and stimulate cytokine expression and recruitment of monocytes. We have developed an ex-vivo system that models these early inflammatory events in atherogenesis. The influence of a high-fat diet is mimicked by repetitively exposing aortic endothelium in culture to native postprandial TGRL that is freshly-isolated from human plasma. Our primary hypothesis is that native unmodified TGRL amplifies cytokine mediated inflammation via an LDL receptor initiated pathway that is distinct from that of oxidized lipoprotein and the scavenger receptor pathway. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with vascular regions of low shear stress and disturbed flow that are sites of lipid accumulation and monocyte recruitment both of which accelerate the inflammatory axis of atherogenesis. A systems bioengineering approach is applied to study this process at the cell and molecular scale under defined shear stress as described in three Specific Aims: 1) To define how repetitive exposure of human aortic endothelial cells to TGRL primes for enhanced vascular inflammation and atherogenesis employing a vascular mimetic flow channel system. 2) To analyze the inflammatory events in atherogenesis at the level of gene transcription and protein expression by aortic endothelial cells under conditions of well defined fluid shear stress. 3) To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying monocyte recruitment to atherogenic endothelium in vascular mimetic flow channels. Our overall goal is to identify how dietary lipoproteins from healthy and metabolic syndrome subjects act as proinflammatory mediators in shifting the balance from healthy to atherogenic endothelium.Project Narrative:     Few studies have focused on the earliest event in atherosclerosis when endothelium succumbs to hyperlipidemia and lowers its normal defenses to stave off inflammation. A significant outcome of the proposed studies would be to develop a lab on a chip that measures the inflammatory potential of an individual's lipids after a meal. This would reflect a person's metabolic profile and correlate with their propensity to develop atherosclerosis and heart disease.      ","477562",

A number of clinical studies have shown that the post-MI left ventricular function is significantly worse in diabetic compared with non- diabetic patients. However what is lacking is a plausible relationship between diabetes and any of the known regulators of myocyte apoptosis known to play a significant role in the post-MI cardiac dysfunction. Recently we have demonstrated that a novel signaling between phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) and inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) the PDE3A-ICER feedback loop is a likely mechanism determining the fate of injured myocytes. Our recent preliminary data to be presented in this proposal indicate that ERK5 an atypical mitogen activated protein kinase with transcriptional activity regulates the PDE3A-ICER feedback loop and that the ERK5 transcriptional activity itself is subjected to down regulation by a hyperglycemia- dependent small ubiquitin-related modification (SUMO). p90RSK a kinase activated in diabetes increases ERK5-SUMOylation and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Our working hypothesis is that inhibition of ERK5 transcriptional activity in diabetic heart by p90RSK-mediated ERK5-SUMOylation results in a proapoptotic condition likely to contribute to poor post-MI cardiac ventricular function. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Determine the role of p90RSK activation on streptozotocin-induced exacerbation of left ventricular remodeling after MI in vivo. Aim 2. Determine the role of p90RSK-ERK5 axis on streptozotocin- induced exacerbation of LV remodeling after MI in vivo. Aim 3: Determine the molecular mechanisms by which p90RSK functions as an inhibitor for ERK5 transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes in vitro. Aim 4: Determine the role of angiotensin II reactive oxygen species and high glucose-mediated endogenous p90RSK activation and subsequent ERK5-SUMOylation in PDE3A-ICER feedback loop-mediated apoptosis and inhibition of SERCA2 and 21-adrenergic receptor expression in vitro and we will investigate the functional significance of the molecular interaction between p90RSK and ERK5 transcriptional regulation through extensive use of adenovirus in an in vitro myocyte ststem. The broad-based experimental approach including the use of various transgenic mice and gene transduction viral vectors should allow us to determine the importance of p90RSK-ERK5 axis in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Moreover we believe that our novel small molecule specific p90RSK inhibitor should provide a new therapeutic strategy for reducing post- ischemic cardiac dysfunction in diabetics.      ","516955",

Yet we have little understanding of how immune responses can be maintained to chronic infections over the long-term or the relationship between the magnitude of the immune response and pathogen load. Here we propose to address the basic mechanisms underlying persistent T cell responses using a mouse model of Mtb infection. It has been established that although CD4+ T cells play an instrumental role in the control of Mtb infection in humans and mice these cells are not able to completely clear the infection thereby allowing the bacteria to persist in the lung (the bacterial ""setpoint""). Our preliminary data show that the T cell response to chronic Mtb infection is dynamic and characterized by rapid and continual CD4+ T cell proliferation and cytokine production. However we don't know how this robust T cell response is maintained over the long term. In particular we have very little information on whether the effector T cells continually proliferate or become exhausted whether resting memory T cell pools are established at sites distal to the infection or the relative contribution of CD8+ T cells. To address these issues we have developed a T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse specific for an Mtb secreted antigen. We will take advantage of these mice to identify the mechanisms underlying persistent T cell responses and determine how the balance between the T cell response and bacterial setpoint is maintained. In Aim 1 we will determine how antigen-specific T cell responses are maintained during a persistent Mtb infection characterized by chronic antigen exposure. The basic approach will be to transfer naive transgenic T cells into mice that have been aerosol-infected with Mtb and then track the donor cells by flow cytometry. This will allow us to determine the distribution longevity phenotype and function of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in detail during the course of infection. In Aim 2 we will determine the extent to which antigen-specific T cells regulate the bacterial setpoint. This will be accomplished by determining the extent to which we can modulate the bacterial load setpoint by altering the number and/or function of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. In addition we will determine whether CD4+ T cells are the source of IFN? in regulating the bacterial load setpoint. In parallel we will also determine the extent to which antigen-specific CD8+ T cells contribute to protective immunity. By precisely defining the contribution of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells these studies will have important implications for the development of vaccines that promote enhanced control of Mtb infection.    Relevance: Pathogens that mediate chronic infections such as Mtb are a major public heath threat. The proposed studies will generate information on the maintenance of protective T cell responses and will facilitate the development of new vaccines and therapies against this class of pathogens.      ","458860",

Investigations will be focused on catalytic asymmetric methods that deliver products that can be used in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and cannot be easily accessed by any existing protocols. Design and development of new catalysts and catalytic asymmetric protocols for organic synthesis are compelling objectives. One of the most important and rapidly emerging classes of transformations in organic chemistry is catalytic olefin metathesis. Readily available unsaturated compounds through ring-closing ring-opening or cross-metathesis reactions are converted into a wide range of cyclic or acyclic compounds. Asymmetric olefin metathesis provides access to molecules that cannot be easily prepared by reactions of enantiomerically pure substrates in the presence of achiral catalysts partly because methods for preparation of the requisite enantiomerically enriched substrates do not yet exist. We will design and develop new classes of Mo- and W-based chiral olefin metathesis catalysts that can be prepared in situ by new practical and efficient methods from easily accessible precursors. We will utilize the mechanistic understanding obtained during previous studies in this program to introduce catalysts with one or more of the following unique attributes: stereogenic metal center cationic metal center monodentate chiral ligand. The catalysts developed in this program will be utilized in the development of new and unique catalytic diastereo- and enantioselective methods in olefin metathesis. Catalytic asymmetric reactions will be designed that deliver synthetically versatile products such as cyclic amines and amides which are otherwise difficult to access; the majority of products contain an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic center an important and notoriously difficult-to-access moiety that is found in a variety of molecules of exceptional biological activity. Enantioselective total synthesis of biologically active alkaloids quebrachamine (adrenergic blocker) and rhazinilam (anti-cancer) will thus be accomplished through unique routes rendered feasible by the new chiral catalysts and catalytic asymmetric methods developed in this program. Efficient practical and highly stereoselective methods for preparation of chiral organic molecules are critical to the availability of therapeutic agents. Design and development of new catalysts and catalytic asymmetric protocols for organic synthesis are compelling objectives. Easily prepared and highly active chiral olefin metathesis catalysts that furnish unique routes for the synthesis of heteroatom-containing compounds are the goals of this program and of notable significance in medicinal research.      ","565746",

Adipocytes of insulin resistant individuals produce and secrete larger amounts of these adipokines and bioactive molecules with the exception of adiponectin an anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing adipokine. Skeletal muscle adipokine receptors may dictate the impact of these circulating proteins on the degree of insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. Inflammation is a risk factor for stroke and contributes to the progression of cardiovascular disease. Moreover there is a high prevalence of hyperinsulinemia and individuals are at increased risk for diabetes after   stroke. The fundamental hypothesis of this study is that key inflammatory markers (TRNa adiponectin) in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are abnormal skeletal muscle insulin signaling is impaired and systemic insulin sensitivity is reduced in hemiparetic stroke patients and that these factors are modifiable and improved by exercise training in stroke patients. The aims of this study are the following: 1) To determine whether key systemic (TRNa and adiponectin circulating levels) and tissue (adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) inflammation (secretion expression and cytokine   receptor TNFR1 TNFR2 adipoR1 adipoR2 expression) are disturbed in chronic stroke compared to age sex BMI race and risk-factor matched non-stroke controls and whether a 6-month randomized treadmill training intervention modifies these inflammatory markers in stroke patients; and 2) To determine whether a 6-month randomized treadmill training intervention improves systemic insulin sensitivity compared to stretch control in stroke patients by altering downstream signaling (AMPK JNK IRS1- Ser307 Akt and p-38 MAPK phosphorylation) and GS activity in hemiparetic and nonparetic leg skeletal muscles. To accomplish these aims 90 subjects (n=18 controls and n=72 hemiparetic stroke patients) aged 55-75 years BMI 20-35 kg/m2 will undergo abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue biopsies and basal and insulin-stimulated vastus lateralis muscle biopsies during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Stroke subjects will be assigned to 6 month treadmill or education/stretch control intervention using a one-two-one randomization blocked on race sex and glucose tolerance status.  This clinical translational research trial takes physiological outcomes from the clinic to the bench to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the systemic insulin resistance in stroke compared to age and risk-factor matched non-stroke controls and whether treadmill training reduces inflammation and improves systemic insulin sensitivity in stroke. Direct measurement of inflammatory modulators in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle will provide novel information as to whether selected cytokines   adversely affect insulin signaling at the skeletal muscle. Furthermore the mechanistic findings will provide the first evidence of the molecular mechanisms by which treadmill training improves inflammatory regulators in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and improves insulin signaling and action in skeletal muscle to increase insulin sensitivity in older stroke patients. This research will identify a strategy to treat insulin resistance in stroke survivors and establish the biological basis for recommending lifestyle modifications to reduce inflammation and improve the metabolic profile in stroke.        ","497533",

As a research database system SMD provides not only data storage and access control but current biological annotation and a variety of tools for data retrieval quality assessment and analysis which support pre- and post-publication uses of microarray data. SMD supports both two-color data (including the output of the GenePix ScanAlyze and Agilent feature extraction software) and single-channel data from Affymetrix GeneChips and Nimblegen Arrays. The Stanford installation serves hundreds of researchers at Stanford and their collaborators at over one hundred institutions worldwide and provides public access to data from approximately 12000 microarrays. SMD's software has had regular releases over the last three years and been installed at several other institutions on a variety of operating systems and database platforms serving many researchers at those sites. The major goals of this proposed project are to expand and improve the tools in SMD to further enable biomedical research and to provide biologists and data analysts with greater control and consistency in their analyses. In the first funding period of this grant we specifically focused on development of the database infrastructure to make robust and regular releases of SMD's code and schema. In this renewal application we are expanding our focus to provide additional tools that will benefit users of SMD installations. Specifically we propose to (1) provide continued maintenance release and support of the SMD software package (2) significantly increase the number of analysis tools and speed with which they can be adopted by integrating the GenePattern software into the SMD software package which will also allow users to create data retrieval pipelines (3) create tools that enable SMD users to easily import data from the ArrayExpress and GEO public microarray data repositories and (4) provide data structures and software to provide support in SMD for higher density platforms such as tiling and SNP arrays. In sum completion of these aims will provide biomedical researchers and clinicians with powerful tools that will allow them to more completely analyze their own microarray data as well as derive more benefit from already published microarray data thereby increasing the value of both. Biomedical research is rapidly evolving largely due to the application of high-throughput technologies such as microarrays. Many clinicians and researchers are using microarrays in innovative ways to investigate a diversity of human diseases from cancer to infectious diseases to heart disease as well as fundamental aspects of basic biology which frequently provide new insights into human biology. This proposal provides these researchers with a database and tools with which they can organize and analyze their data and ensure that their research has the greatest possible impact on human health.      ","398000",

Depending on the species Leishmania-induced pathology ranges from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral diseases. Leishmania express a family of structurally interrelated glycoconjugates dominated by its surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG) that have critical roles in parasite survival and virulence. The sharing of structural domains among virtually all parasite surface glycoconjugates however often leads to imprecision in our understanding of their unique and/or overlapping roles in vivo. Through identification of specific mutants through forward and reverse genetics and generation of genetically complemented counterparts we have established a powerful approach enabling us to systematically dissect the biosynthetic pathway of LPG and related glycoconjugates. We plan to focus on mutants defective in a well chosen set of biochemical steps and genes that will allow us to dissect the role of individual glycoconjugates and/or their specific domains in various stages of the infections cycle. The ability of infectious metacyclic parasites to enter survive and differentiate into amastigotes following ingestion by macrophages will be studied; where possible amastigote initiated infections will be performed as well as glycoconjugate function can differ greatly in the two infectious stages. The ability of metacyclic promastigotes or amastigotes to induce pathology in susceptible and resistant mice will be studied and long term persistence evaluated. Lastly in collaboration with David Sacks we will evaluate the ability of promastigotes fed within a blood meal to survive and develop within the sand fly vector. Several pathways identified show potential for chemotherapy and/or vaccination strategies in the future. Our ultimate goal is a comprehensive understanding of the genes and gene products responsible for synthesizing Leishmania surface and secreted molecules and their individual and specific roles in parasite virulence. The four specific aims of this competing renewal application are: 1. To identify candidate glycoconjugate(s) that are key virulence molecules responsible for amastigote stage virulence in L. major as defined by studies of the avirulent persistent lpg2- mutant. 2. To characterize new families of mannosyl-phosphate transferases and galactosyltransferases involved in synthesis of the phosphoglycan (PG) repeating unit Gal(214)Man(11)-PO4- backbone. 3. To determine the role of the emerging sphingolipid (SL) pathway and inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC) in amastigotes. 4. To develop comprehensive Leishmania glycomics. As part of these studies we plan to test whether the recently discovered active RNAi pathway of L. braziliensis may be productively incorporated into the study of Leishmania glycoconjugates.Project Narrative     Leishmania are important tropical parasites causing disease in more than 10 million people worldwide; more than 400 million people are at risk for infection in endemic regions. US military personnel have significant risk of infection in these areas as well. Depending on the species Leishmania-induced pathology ranges from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral diseases. Currently there are no vaccines available against leishmaniasis and the only approved chemotherapies are marginally effective difficult to administer and have significant associated toxicities. The underlying tenet of our research program is that improved understanding of key pathways required for parasite virulence and viability may provide opportunities for the development of improved therapies. Leishmania express a family of structurally interrelated glycoconjugates dominated by its surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG) that have critical roles in parasite survival and virulence. The sharing of structural domains among virtually all parasite surface glycoconjugates however complicates our understanding of their unique and/or overlapping roles in vivo. To overcome this we use genetic approaches to make parasite mutants altered in specific molecules or domains or smaller substitutions. As there are many possible steps and some of their effects may be similar we try to choose ones that will give us the greatest information. Then we test each mutant in the parasite infectious cycle. Leishmania are normally transmitted by the bite of an infected sand fly so the first step in infection is the deposition of infective metacyclic form parasites into the skin where they are taken up by macrophages. There they resist host defenses and differentiate into another form called amastigotes which are adapted for replication and go on to cause disease. Eventually sand flies bite infected animals and the parasite has to survive within the alimentary tract of the fly. We have good assays for testing the effect of each mutant in each of the steps throughout the infectious cycle. We have good success in previous work and several pathways and molecules already identified show potential for chemotherapy and/or vaccination strategies in the future. Our ultimate goal is a comprehensive understanding of the genes and gene products responsible for synthesizing Leishmania surface and secreted molecules and their individual and specific roles in parasite virulence.      ","739661",

We present evidence that developmental reprogramming of the prostate by estrogens may be mediated in part through epigenetic alterations. Using methylation-sensitive fingerprinting (MSRP) as an initial screen for genome-wide methylation changes we identified multiple prostatic genes whose methylation status was permanently altered in rats as a result of neonatal estradiol and bisphenol A (BPA) exposures at environmentally relevant doses. Detailed characterization of phosphodiesterase 4D4 (PDE4D4) and HPCAL enzymes involved in cAMP breakdown and formation respectively revealed aberrant promoter CpG island methylation patterns with resultant changes in gene transcription as the animals aged. Importantly these epigenetic alterations were associated with increased susceptibility to hormonal carcinogenesis of the rat prostate gland. Thus we hypothesize that early estrogenic  imprinting  of the prostate gland with resultant predisposition to carcinogenesis with aging is mediated through epigenetic modifications which permanently affect gene expression in the gland. The objectives of the present proposal are to further characterize our model of developmental reprogramming by low dose estradiol or BPA to characterize in detail the prostatic gene methylation and transcriptional alterations which result from early life estrogenic exposures and to identify the methylation candidate genes contribute to increased carcinogenic potential in the developmentally estrogenized prostate glands. In Aim 1 we will determine the dose-response relationship for prostatic- BPA effects and establish the developmental windows of susceptibility. We will also use a novel tissue recombination model to test whether BPA modifies carcinogenic susceptibility and methylation patterns in human prostate-like structures. In Aim 2 we will characterize in detail the altered rat prostate methylome with resultant alterations in gene expression as a result of developmental exposures to environmentally relevant doses of BPA or estradiol. MSRP and methylation arrays will be used to expand our prostatic screen to identify a full panel of candidate genes and a stringent algorithm will be followed to identify candidates with regulatory CpG islands. Site-specific methylation and resultant transcriptional regulation will be confirmed. In Aim 3 we will directly test whether the genes epigenetically modified by estrogenic exposures play an active role in prostate gland carcinogenesis using a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies.      ","504593",

Instead they end in a conserved stemloop structure. The synthesis of histone proteins is tightly coupled to DNA replication and this is controlled largely by regulating histone mRNA. In early embryos all organisms must produce histone proteins in the absence of transcription and many embryos including frogs and Drosophila must produce massive amounts of histone proteins in a short time during the extremely rapid early cell divisions. We have carried out a genome wide RNAi screen for factors involved in histone mRNA processing using Drosophila cultured cells. We will determine the function of these factors in the processing reaction (components of the U7 snRNP and the cleavage factor) as well as other possible previously unknown factors and identify which factors are present in the Histone Locus Body. We also obtained factors involved in replication-independent chromatin assembly in the screen suggesting that the pathways for replication-dependent and replication-independent histone protein metabolism directly interact. We will determine the role of these factors in histone mRNA regulation in the fly using available mutants in many of these factors. We will also determine the molecular mechanism of regulation of histone mRNA translation in Xenopus oocytes focusing on the role of the stemloop binding protein and a novel protein that it interacts with in translation. This novel protein SLIP1 is likely involved in translation regulation of other mRNAs and we will identify what other pathways it participates in.        ","350038",

In order to find contact and infect the host the invasive stages of these parasites must receive and process a variety of sensory cues from their physical and biological environments including the host itself. Moreover the human parasite Strongyloides stercoralis is unique in its ability to undergo fulminant autoinfection in which progeny of parasitic females develop rapidly to infectivity penetrate the gut wall and invade the tissues of their primary host. Unregulated autoinfection can bring about geometric expansion of the parasite population resulting in overwhelming potentially fatal disease. The overall goal of this project is to understand the roles of sensory neurons and neuronal networks in regulating the infective process in parasitic nematodes generally. The research plan comprises three specific aims: 1.) to elucidate neuronal control of key steps in the infective process in S. stercoralis infection. Here ablation by laser microbeam will be used to test hypotheses that specific neurons control behaviors such as negative geotaxis chemotaxis towards molecules from the host skin and initiation of parasitic development. 2.) To reconstruct the sensory neuroanatomy of the parasitic nematode Parastrongyloides trichosuri; compare it to C. elegans and to more or less closely related parasitic nematodes. P. trichosuri has a distinct advantage over previously used models in that it can be reared in vitro as a free-living organism while remaining capable of infecting a host via a program of development and migration that is common in obligate parasites. Anticipating that it will be used increasingly as a model for basic research it is crucial to confirm the similarity of P. trichosuri's sensory neuroanatomy and function to other free-living and parasitic nematodes. 3.) To seek molecular markers for specific amphidial neurons of S. stercoralis. This work will establish a third criterion in addition to anatomical position and function for establishing homologies between sensory neurons in parasitic nematodes and C. elegans. We will also explore the use of transgene constructs containing neuron- specific promoters coupled to mutant channel forming proteins as tools for genetic ablation of sensory neurons and possibly other types of cells in S. stercoralis and other parasitic nematodes. Though underappreciated by the medical establishments of developed nations parasitic nematodes cause disease in almost half a billion persons living primarily in developing countries. Some of the most important of these pathogens hookworms and threadworms infect their hosts via the per-cutaneous route. We propose to continue with a program of research aimed at understanding the neuronal control of key behaviors associated with the infective process in the threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis and a related parasite Parastrongyloides trichosuri seeking for the first time to take our studies to the molecular level thereby providing a rational framework for the discovery of new drug targets that could interfere with this process.      ","393750",

We have reported previously that light stimulates various components of the PI Cycle in vertebrate ROS including DG kinase PI synthetase PIP kinase (PIPK) phospholipase C (PLC) and PI 3-kinase (PI3K). We have reported that G-protein coupled receptor rhodopsin regulates the phosphorylation of retinal insulin receptor in vivo and activates PI3K which forms PI-345-P3 and other D3-phosphorylated PIs in ROS. In other tissues these second messengers have been shown to affect a large number of intracellular events including secretion cell survival membrane trafficking and actin polymerization all of which are important in the retina. It is our hypothesis that light-stimulation of this reaction in photoreceptor cell outer segments affects important photoreceptor cell function(s) not related to visual transduction. The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate the physiological role of these lipid second messengers in photoreceptor cells. Recently we have reported that deletion downstream effectors of PI3K Akt2 and Bcl-xl resulted in stress-induced photoreceptor degeneration. These studies clearly suggest that PI3K generated phosphoinositides are important regulators of photoreceptor survival and maintenance. To this end we will determine the functional role of PI3K in photoreceptor cells identify and characterize protein targets for 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides determine Akt2 interacting proteins that are necessary for cell survival and determine the mechanism of regulation of PI-45-P2 levels in rod outer segments. We will utilize a combination of genetic molecular biological and biochemical approaches to address the proposed studies. Results of these studies will lead to a better understanding of the role of PI3K generated phosphoinositides in photoreceptor structure function and survival.      ","366250",

Children with ADHD-I have a profile of attention deficits comorbid disorders social impairments and neurocognitive dysfunction that differs from that associated with ADHD-Combined Type (ADHD-C). The extent of these differences precludes straightforward assumptions that treatment outcome findings for ADHD-C can be generalized to ADHD-I. Through funding from an R21 Treatment Development grant we have developed a novel psychosocial treatment (Integrated Multi-Setting Psychosocial Treatment--IPT) for ADHD-I. IPT combines a standard behavioral treatment for ADHD (parent training) that has been adapted for ADHD-I with child life skills training (supportive strategies drawn from rehabilitation medicine) and with teacher consultation. As part of the R21 we conducted a small-scale randomized controlled trial comparing IPT to an untreated control group and demonstrated (a) significant treatment effects on inattention and academic and social impairment and (b) feasibility and acceptability of the model. These positive outcomes justify the current application which aims to provide a dual-site randomized clinical trial of IPT. We will randomize [210] children with ADHD-I ages 7-11 (2nd-5th grades) to IPT ([N=78]) Parent-Focused Training (PFT [N=78]) or Treatment as Usual TAU ([N=54]). The goal of the RCT is to test whether IPT provides superior reduction of DSM-IV inattention symptoms as rated by parents and teachers (the primary endpoint) in comparison to standard community treatment TAU; and to [PFT] which constitutes an active treatment that is effective at reducing symptoms of ADHD. We will include medicated and unmedicated children and will recruit from a broad array of clinics and schools consistent with our goal of increasing generalizability. Secondary analyses will evaluate the effects of the intervention across multiple domains of impairment including academic and social functioning and on objective measures of attention and parenting derived from observations during standard clinic-based tasks and on curriculum-based measures of academic achievement. We predict that ADHD-I symptoms will be significantly lower and secondarily that academic and social functioning will be significantly higher in IPT relative to TAU]. We hypothesize that ADHD-I symptoms will be significantly lower and secondarily that academic and social functioning will be significantly higher in the IPT group relative to [PFT]. We will also examine the durability of treatment gains at [5-7] month follow-up. We predict that ADHD-I symptoms will remain lowest and academic/social functioning will remain highest in the IPT group relative to the other groups at follow-up. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Attention-deficit\Hyperactivity Disorder Predominantly Inattentive type is a prevalent and serious childhood psychiatric disorder which severely and persistently impacts a child's functioning at school at home and with peers. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention integrating school home and child skills components for improving attentional symptoms and academic and social functioning in these children.      ","694658",

First we will develop novel statistical methods for population genetic inference from high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms. Pyrosequencing technology will generate assembled alignments that represent a sampling of sequence reads across individuals (multinomial) and across homologous chromosomes within an individual (binomial) producing a complex mixture. Inference of population genetic parameters from such data will demand novel statistical approaches and we outline a set of plans to develop statistically rigorous methods. Second we will develop methods for reverse-engineer the ascertainment biases of SNPs on widely used genotyping panels so as to enable population genetic inference. SNPs on the high-throughput genotyping platforms of Affymetrix and Illumina were ascertained in diverse and often irretrievable ways. Statistically sound population genetic inference from these data requires an understanding of the nature of the ascertainment bias of these platforms. We will reverse engineer the ascertainment by use of ENCODE and other dense resequence data and use these inferences to perform ascertainment bias correction to high- density SNP platform data. Third we will develop novel methods for inference of natural selection from patterns of haplotype diversity within and among human populations and apply these approaches to publicly available data sets. Methods of inference of natural selection from SNP frequency and haplotype diversity continue to gain in power and specificity. Optimization of these methods demands correction for effects of ascertainment demographic effects local variation in recombination and for imputation of missing data and of haplotype phase. We will make use of Markov-Hidden Markov models for jointly estimating the magnitude location and age of selection sweeps. Finally we will develop novel approaches for predicting the functional consequences of nucleotide substitutions in putatively functional regions of the human genome. Whole-genome association tests will gain power and specificity from the use of prior inference of the likelihood that a SNP has a damaging effect on a gene's function. In addition after genome-wide association tests there will follow extensive resequencing of candidate regions and inference of the likelihood of deleterious effects of the many rare variants will also have utility. We propose methods that have advantages over existing approaches making use of comparative genomic data protein structure cis-regulatory information and patterns of segregating variation.    Project Narrative: This project will develop methods of statistical inference from human DNA resequencing and SNP genotype data that will allow accurate estimation of critical parameters that describe the structure of variation in human populations. These inferences can provide vital clues to identifying genes that are associated with risk of complex genetic disorders.      ","315000",

Immobilization nerve damage cachexia sepsis and aging induce significant and potentially life-threatening losses in skeletal muscle mass to the point of impairing adequate ambulatory or respiratory function. Adrenal glucocorticoid hormones are potent inducers of skeletal muscle atrophy. Physiological glucocorticoid levels support muscle atrophy in fasting and chronic illness among other catabolic conditions. In addition synthetic glucocorticoids are used clinically as potent anti-inflammatory drugs with serious side effects such as hyperglycemia insulin resistance and bone cartilage and muscle loss. New selective glucocorticoid receptor ligands have been described that repress inflammatory gene expression but are less potent at up- regulation of other classes of glucocorticoid responsive genes thus showing good pharmaceutical potential. However none of these compounds have been evaluated for effects on skeletal muscle. Inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor action selectively in skeletal muscle would present an opportunity to alleviate atrophy under a variety of conditions. In this proposal we will focus on the role of two recently identified E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx in glucocorticoid induced skeletal muscle atrophy and their transcriptional activation. We propose to 1) determine the relative contribution of MuRF1 and MAFbx genes to glucocorticoid induced skeletal muscle atrophy using mice with selective gene deletions 2) investigate the role of the glucocorticoid receptor in the induction of muscle atrophy as well as MuRF1 and MAFbx expression using mice with a muscle-specific deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor 3) investigate the role of the glucocorticoid receptor and FOXO proteins in regulating MuRF1 gene expression using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and 4) evaluate selective anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid ligands for effects on muscle atrophy and MuRF1 and MAFbx expression. Newly developed genetic resources pharmacological tools and molecular techniques are available to accomplish these aims in the investigator's laboratories and through key collaborations. Thus this proposal represents an opportunity to apply new concepts and cutting-edge technology regarding glucocorticoid receptor function directly to the clinically relevant and unmet problem of skeletal muscle atrophy.         ","319969",

Recent advances in research on socioeconomic disadvantage and child development by our research team and others have shifted concern from whether income poverty has an impact on children's outcomes to more complex questions regarding how poverty takes a toll on children questions of greater relevance to the design of program and policy innovations. Thus our objective in this current proposal is to strengthen the field's understanding of the mechanisms through which families' trajectories of income and hardship affect children's trajectories of success versus difficulty in academic and socio-emotional domains. In addition we propose to expand our empirical lens beyond families to the important contribution of school socio-economic disadvantage to children's development. In what represents a synthesis of the investigators' expertise in developmental psychology social work education public policy and sociology we propose to address the following aims: Aim I: To examine how the timing sequence and duration of changes in family- level disadvantage impact the development of children's academic skills and social-emotional competence across elementary school and into middle school. Aim II: To apply the theoretical frame of specificity of environmental action to understanding the impact of school-level disadvantage on children's academic achievement and social-emotional competence. Aim III: To examine the independent joint and sequential dynamic impacts of family-level and school-level contextual transitions on families' income and hardship and in turn on the development of children's achievement and social-emotional competence. We will analyze data from all five waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to address these aims. Findings from this research have the potential to contribute to policy and program advances that will enhance the life chances of children in poor and low income families. This project aims to understand the mechanisms through which family-level and school-level poverty and disadvantage affect children's cognitive and social-emotional development from kindergarten through 8th grade. Findings from this research have the potential to contribute to policy and program advances that will enhance the life chances of children in poor and low income families.      ","296705",

This will be done by comparing single neuron activity during normal mild moderate and severe parkinsonian symptoms in the same monkeys using sequential low doses of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Structures that will be examined include the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus (GPi and GPe respectively) the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the motor thalamus including ventralis anterior ventralis lateralis pars oralis and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis. Specific aims 1 and 2 will determine the characteristics of neuronal activity at these nodal points within the basal ganglia network that underlie the development of bradykinesia rigidity and tremor and characterize the evolution of changes in neuronal activity that occur with increasing severity of these motor signs. Specific aim 2 will also determine the relative effect of fiber sparing lesions of each thalamic subnucleus on individual motor signs. Specific aim 3 will assess the causal role of the particular changes in neurophysiological activity found to occur in specific aims 1 and 2. This will be done by reproducing these neurophysiological changes in the STN and GPi in normal monkeys and augmenting them in mildly parkinsonian monkeys using externally programmed implanted stimulators at these nodal points. By examining the neurophysiological changes that occur at different stages of PD and relating them to the occurrence and severity of individual motor symptoms we will be able to clarify the neuronal basis underlying the development and severity of motor signs associated with PD. This will in turn provide the rationale from which to base the development of promising new therapies such as deep brain stimulation and gene therapy that are directed at modulating neuronal activity in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit. The goal of this study is to identify the specific changes in the activity of brain cells in the basal ganglia that cause the movement problems in Parkinson's disease (PD). People with PD develop specific problems with movement manifested as slowness (bradykinesia) stiffness (rigidity) and uncontrollable rhythmic movements in the extremities and face (tremor). This study will identify the specific changes in brain activity that cause each motor symptom and determine how they are related to increasing severity of each symptom. The results of this study will provide the understanding necessary for the refinement of current and development of future therapies e.g. deep brain stimulation and gene therapy directed at modulating the neuronal activity in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit responsible for the development of PD motor symptoms.      ","515380",

Additionally the medications used to treat IBD specifically steroids may induce depression cause sleep problems and adversely impact health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We will investigate the effects that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a physical narrative focus has on the child's emotional state and several health-related factors (e.g. HRQOL medication adherence IBD severity) in children and adolescents 9 -17 years of age with IBD and clinically significant depression. Participants will be randomized to either CBT designed for youth with IBD or supportive non-directive therapy (SNDT). Individuals in the CBT group will learn new cognitive strategies (i.e. reconstruction of personal physical illness narratives coping strategies and social skills) and alternate behaviors (i.e. positive activities family communication sleep hygiene relaxation) to improve emotional (mood) and health (HRQOL adherence IBD severity) functioning. Participants in the time and attention control group of SNDT will receive social support and information about depression. Both groups will have parent (family) sessions provided at the beginning middle and end of the study. For CBT these sessions will seek to improve family understanding and communication about the physical illness and the skills being taught to the patient; for (SNDT) we will provide non-directive support. The goals of this study are to assess the efficacy of the CBT versus SNDT on emotional (reducing symptoms of depression) and physical health (HRQOL medication adherence; IBD severity) outcomes. Secondary analyses will assess changes in IBD course pain sleep and illness perceptions with treatment. The relationship between health outcomes and depression will also be examined in exploratory manner. Putative moderators (e.g. anxiety steroid use and pubertal status) of CBT effects on depression and HRQOL will be explored. This will be the first study to explore the effects of CBT on physical health outcomes over and above the effects attributable to changes in depression in a pediatric IBD population. This approach represents an important paradigm shift in using a behavioral intervention integrated into medical treatment to target both emotional and physical health problems. Two sites will be used to obtain the targeted sample size of 112 per intervention group. A benefit of this research is a better understanding of both the emotional and physical health effects of chronic illness in youth and will serve to help other similar pediatric populations. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)/Children's Hospital Pittsburgh and Harvard University/Children's Hospital Boston plan to collaborate on this 5 year project. This project will investigate the effects of CBT on depression and physical health-related outcomes in children and adolescents with IBD. This will be the first study that will also explore the effects of CBT on physical health outcomes over and above the effects attributable to changes in depression.

Because of its pivotal role in disease pathogenesis a number of strategies to inhibit anthrax toxin are currently under development including monoclonal antibody- based therapies. However there is significant concern about the ease with which the bacterium may be engineered to avoid vaccine protection or antitoxin therapy e.g. by removing antibody-binding sites from the protective antigen (PA) toxin subunit. A next-generation strategy for antitoxin development one that addresses this limitation involves the use of a soluble receptor decoy inhibitor (RDI); Presumably PA cannot be engineered to evade cellular receptor recognition and therefore the RDI should be effective even against forms of PA that have been deliberately altered to resist antibody neutralization. We have recently developed an RDI which has many properties desirable in a broadly acting anthrax therapeutic: it binds to the receptor-binding site of PA with an affinity that is on a par with some of the leading therapeutic antibodies (Kd = 0.2nM); it blocks intoxication via both known cellular receptors for anthrax toxin; its dissociation rate from PA is extremely slow (t1/2 complex = 15 hours); it is non-immunogenic; its production is easily scaleable using a bacterial expression system; it can neutralize PA at stoichiometric concentrations and protects rats against toxin killing. This research plan represents a comprehensive strategy for advancing the RDI as a candidate therapy for anthrax. We will characterize and optimize its pharmacokinetic properties by disrupting its interaction with its physiological ligands (collagen IV and laminin) and by exploiting PEGylation and Ig fusion protein approaches. We will also establish if this class of inhibitor is effective at neutralizing antibody-resistant forms of PA as expected. Moreover we will establish if this class of inhibitor can prevent disease in mice caused by Sterne spores that express either wild-type or antibody-resistant PA. These experiments will set the stage for future studies aimed at establishing the effectiveness of the RDI in preventing disease caused by highly virulent strains of B. anthracis. We anticipate that the RDI will be a useful adjunct anthrax therapy that could potentially synergize with monoclonal antibodies to treat infections caused by wild-type bacterial strains while at the same time providing a straightforward strategy for dealing with engineered weaponized bacterial strains. Anthrax represents one of the greatest bioterrorism threats to the citizens of the United States. The aim of the proposed research is to develop a soluble therapeutic that will be effective against common strains of the bacterium that causes anthrax as well as against weaponized bacterial strains.      ","496525",

Early detection appears currently to be the only way of improving the high mortality rate but is quite difficult because of the lack of symptoms in early disease. Moreover lung cancer is mimicked in its in vivo image appearance by benign lesions and processes that lower the specificity of detection. Current imaging methods include chest x-ray CT and MRI. While these current methods are able to identify curable lung cancer they also result in many false positives. They are also limited in the size of the lung nodules they can detect. Using available criteria sensitivity for lung cancer detection is high but specificity and positive predictive value are only moderate. Thus there is a need for enhanced sensitivity and specificity for cancer cells. Our Anti-transferrin Receptor scFv-antibody fragment (TfRscFv) immunoliposome complex (scL) is a nanoconstruct (~100 nm) for delivery of gene therapy to tumors. It has been shown to target various types of human tumor cells in vivo when implanted as xenografts in mice and is now in Phase I clinical trials for delivery of wtp53. What we are proposing in this application is a quantum jump in diagnostic accuracy an approach specific to cancer and best for small cancers such as lung cancer. The method we are developing is a nano- sized immunoliposome complex delivering superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO). Iron Oxide particles are both paramagnetic and super-paramagnetic giving a biphasic response with both T1 and T2* features. This complex targets cancer cells with high selectivity. Thus the efficient delivery of SPIO directly into the tumor cells by the scL-SPIO complex of this application can increase the conspicuity of the lung tumor cells. Moreover based on previous studies the nanocomplex delivered contrast agent which is the focus of this application should accumulate within the cancer cells themselves remaining for an extended period (hours) allowing the contrast in non-cancer areas to wash out further enhancing cancer conspicuity. In preliminary studies using an as yet unoptimized scL-SPIO complex we demonstrated tumor cell specificity as compared to free SPIO and enhanced image intensity. More importantly in earlier studies with scL complexed with another imaging agent gadopentate dimeglumine (gad-d) in a lung tumor model the scL-gad-d (and not free gad-d) was able to enhance and identify lung tumors as small as 1-4 pixels (0.1-0.4mm) a size smaller than possible with current technology. No toxicity was found with this complex. In this application we will optimize the scL- SPIO complex and fully characterize its capabilities for use in early detection of lung cancer in a mouse model of human lung cancer and extend our studies to a mouse model of primary lung cancer. In collaboration with investigators at NIST and NCI we will also asses the magnetic properties of the complex and determine it sub cellular localization and trafficking through the cell. Our goal is to perform the majority of the studies necessary for filing an IND as we aim to move rapidly towards clinical trials. If cancer is detected early (e.g. Stage I) it can in many instances be cured (lower mortality). The challenge is to be able to find and positively identify the cancer at this early stage particularly lung cancer. While the current methods of detection are good they can only detect tumors of a certain size. Moreover lung cancer is often mimicked during imaging by non-cancerous lesions resulting in uncertainty and many false positives which are often resolved only by following growth of the tumor. Thus there is a pressing need for imaging agents that increase sensitivity and specificity. Our tumor-specific nano complex delivery of an MR imaging agent e.g. gad-d and iron oxide has shown great promise in our preliminary studies in this regard demonstrating that its high affinity for cancer cells in the lung can result in improved sensitivity in detecting tumors and in overall specificity. The development of an imaging agent that can lead to earlier detection is a high priority in the war on cancer and could lead to increased survival.      ","614637",

Cerium oxide nanoparticles are currently being studied for use in solid oxide fuel cells and as catalysts in catalytic converters primarily based on unique properties of oxygen vacancies within the cerium oxide lattice. In addition to industrial uses recent evidence reported in the literature suggests that ceria nanoparticles can scavenge radicals and act as potent antioxidants in cell culture models and animal studies. Cerium nanoparticles have shown lifespan extension in primary neuronal cultures as well as protection from radiation induced cell death by apoptosis. Although it is clear these nanoparticles are impacting the cell in a profound way the molecular mechanism by which these nanoparticles act is not well understood. Our recent studies have uncovered a potential molecular mechanism for this protection. The aims of this application focus on elucidating the biophysical properties of vacancy engineered nanoparticles that result in this antioxidant activity. We will synthesize ceria nanoparticles that vary in size and oxidation state (Cerium in +3 versus +4 states). We will test these nanoparticles for their antioxidant potential in both biochemical assays as well as cell culture based experiments. We will test these particles using a well established culture model for aging human lung fibroblasts. Once the biophysical properties that are responsible for this antioxidant activity are uncovered we will optimize the synthesis of ceria nanoparticles so that future studies based on these can move to animal experiments to determine the efficacy of vacancy engineered nanoparticles to treat or even prevent disease. Previous studies have shown that treatment of human and animal cells in culture with vacancy engineered ceria nanoparticles results in increased lifespan of these cells. Our preliminary data have likely uncovered the molecular mechanism behind this protection. The proposed studies have the potential to produce safe nanoparticles that can be further tested for treatment of diseases that are related to elevated oxidative damage to tissues such as cardiovascular disease Alzheimer's disease and cancer.      ","261990",

High throughput screening (HTS) for PTP inhibitors is currently performed using enzyme-based assays and simple non-peptide phosphotyrosine (pTyr) analogs such as para-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) and 68-difluoro-4-methylumbiliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP). An obvious limitation of these universal substrates is their lack of enzyme specificity. Also at present none of the available PTP substrates is amenable to detection of intracellular PTP activity thus precluding the development of cell-based PTP assays. There is an urgent need for new specific PTP assays suitable to both enzyme-based and cell-based HTS for small molecule PTP inhibitors. We recently generated a novel fluorescent pTyr analog phosphocoumaryl-amino-propionic acid (pCAP) which can be incorporated into peptides. Peptides containing pCAP are excellent and specific PTP substrates. pCAP-based PTP assays are highly sensitive and direct and can be used to detect intracellular PTP activity. In this proposal we will optimize pCAP-peptides as substrates for novel specific PTP assays suitable to enzyme-based and cell-based HTS of PTP inhibitors. We will show that pCAP-peptides have better specificity profiles than DiFMUP when used as PTP substrates in enzyme-based assays. We will also show that specificity of pCAP peptide can be further improved using a library-screening approach. Highly specific pCAP-peptides will then be used to validate an innovative cell-based PTP assay and optimized for HTS of small molecule PTP inhibitors. We will use the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) as our model PTP as our recent work renders LYP a novel drug target for human autoimmunity. We predict that our new cell-based PTP assay will provide a revolutionary paradigm in HTS for PTP inhibitors in both the academic and industrial setting.      ","298653",

This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB) because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control understanding prevention and treatment of tuberculosis at city state national and international levels. To address this objective we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City New York State United States and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.      ","342967",

Preliminary studies suggest that the mechanism for the chemopreventive activity of a highly efficacious NSAID sulindac does not require the inhibition of COX-1 or -2 and that cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) inhibition is responsible for its tumor cell growth inhibitory activity. We hypothesize that it is feasible to chemically modify sulindac to block COX inhibitory activity while enhancing tumor cell growth inhibitory activity by increasing selectivity for cGMP PDE. In support of this hypothesis we have synthesized a prototypic amide derivative of sulindac sulfide that does not inhibit COX-1 or -2 yet displays high potency to inhibit colon tumor cell growth and cGMP PDE in vitro. Sulindac sulfide amide (SSA) displayed adequate oral bioavailability and appeared to be less toxic than sulindac in mice. Using a xenograft model involving human colon tumor cells SSA displayed comparable in vivo antitumor efficacy as sulindac albeit at high dosages. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of uncoupling the COX inhibitory activity from the growth inhibitory activity of sulindac and supports further research to develop additional derivatives that are more potent and/or bioavailable than SSA. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) prepare a series of sulindac analogs to optimize for potency selectivity and oral bioavailability 2) evaluate in vitro activity 3) determine the mechanism of action and identify the target cGMP PDE isozyme and 4) evaluate in vivo chemopreventive efficacy. Our goals are to identify a safe and efficacious derivative of sulindac for cancer chemoprevention and to critically test the hypothesis that cGMP PDE is a target for cancer chemoprevention. This multidisciplinary research proposal is anticipated to result in a new drug candidate for cancer chemoprevention and in particular patients with familial or sporadic adenomatous polyposis who are at high risk of disease progression.     Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) display striking cancer chemopreventive activity although toxicity resulting from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and incomplete efficacy limits their clinical use for patients at moderate to high risk of disease progression.

Evidence from human and animal studies clearly identifies neurotoxicity as the primary endpoint of concern. However it has been difficult to predict the risk that repeated low-dose exposure to OPs pose to humans because: 1) a relationship between OP dose and neurobehavioral deficits has yet to be established in humans; 2) biomarkers that reliably predict OP-induced neurobehavioral deficits are not available: and 3) the potential for genetic variation to modify exposure sensitivity has not been thoroughly investigated. The proposed studies will test the hypotheses that OP-induced neurobehavioral deficits are dose-related and that measures of oxidative stress and inflammation are better predictors of neurobehavioral deficit than cholinesterase inhibition. These hypotheses will be tested by studying a cohort of pesticide application workers in Egypt's Menoufia Governorate previously reported to exhibit the broadest range of neurobehavioral deficits in humans following OP exposure. This Egyptian cohort is uniquely suited for these studies because unlike most pesticide exposures the exposure is simple (a single OP chlorpyrifos) and consistent within job categories but with substantial differences between job categories. In aim 1 OP doses will be estimated using PBPK/PD modeling of urinary OP metabolite data collected from 255 Egyptian workers over the application cycle. These workers will also be genotyped for polymorphisms of key enzymes involved in OP metabolism (CYP2B6 CYP2C19 and PON1) to evaluate the potential for genetic variation to modify internal dose. In aim 2 behavioral deficits will be determined in a subset of workers exhibiting a range of OP exposures. Data from aims 1 and 2 will be integrated to determine the relationship between OP dose and neurobehavioral deficits. Rat studies will be conducted in parallel (aim 3) to test candidate biomarkers as predictors of OP-induced neurobehavioral deficits. The specific biomarkers that will be examined include cholinesterase inhibition urinary isoprostanes as a measure of oxidative stress and serum levels of C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines as measures of inflammation. In aim 4 those biomarkers that predict OP-induced neurobehavioral deficits in rats will be tested to determine if they similarly predict deficits in behavioral performance in Egyptian pesticide workers. The proposed studies will provide critical data needed to develop effective biomarkers of OP exposure biological response and genetic susceptibility. The availability of such biomarkers would facilitate the identification of at-risk individuals as well as the testing of intervention and treatment strategies and the need to develop these strategies is underscored by evidence of widespread human exposure to OPs and the credible threat of OPs as chemical agents of terrorism. Project Summary/Abstract - Relevance The goal of the proposed studies is to identify biomarkers of exposure and effect that are predictive of neurobehavioral deficits in humans exposed to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs). In addition we will examine human genetic variants of the enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 that influence OP metabolism to not only inform interpretation of OP exposure data but also provide insights into genetic susceptibilities that modulate neurotoxic responses to OPs. These studies will provide data critically needed to identify at-risk individuals and will provide tools to facilitate the development and evaluation of intervention and treatment strategies for exposure to not only OP pesticides which are the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and worldwide but also to nerve agents that are considered a credible terrorist threat.        ","576936",

Wood smoke-derived PM also contributes to ambient PM in these urban areas and is the major source of PM in many US rural or peri-urban areas as well as in many communities within developing countries. This study will focus on indoor air quality and clinically relevant changes in health effects among asthmatics living in homes whose primary heating sources are non EPA-certified woodstoves. The Primary Aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of residential interventions to reduce indoor PM exposure from woodstoves and the corresponding improvements in quality of life and health outcomes for asthmatic children. The study area for this project will be three rural communities in Idaho and western Montana including one Indian Reservation. This study will use a three arm (Tx1 Tx2 and Tx3) randomized placebo-controlled intervention trial. The interventions will be at the household level and exposure and outcomes will be assessed for one asthmatic child in each household. Households in Tx1 will receive inactive high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) devices and will serve as the placebo group. Households in Tx2 will receive a new EPA-certified woodstove while households in Tx3 will receive active HEPA devices. The Secondary Aims of this study are to assess the impact of these interventions on residential PM2.5 exposures and other health outcomes. Secondary exposure outcomes measured prior to and following the intervention will include PM2.5 mass chemical wood smoke markers on PM2.5 filters (including levoglucosan and abietic acids) and biomarkers of wood smoke exposure in urine and exhaled breath condensate. Secondary asthma-related health outcomes measured prior to and following the intervention will include peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (i.e. pH and nitric oxide) and frequency of asthma symptoms medication usage and healthcare utilization. To our knowledge this will be the first randomized trial in the US to utilize a wood smoke intervention to assess the impact of the consequent reductions in indoor PM on health outcomes in a susceptible population. The results from this project will be translatable to other regions in the US and the world where biomass burning is commonly used for heating and cooking. Relevance: This study will determine if reductions in PM2.5 from residential woodstoves a common source of indoor air pollution will result in health improvements among asthmatic children.

The genetic defect in DM1 results in the production of mutant RNAs encoding expanded CUG tracts. Abnormally expanded CUG tracts have been shown to form aberrant mega-complexes that contain the alternative splice factor MBNL1 within the nucleus. Several lines of evidence implicate the formation of these high molecular weight complexes in altered splicing of a subset of physiologically important RNAs and in the subsequent development of DM1 pathology in vivo. To determine the mechanism whereby formation of the MBNL1 mega-complexes alters the splice code in DM1 we propose to purify both normal MBNL1 complexes and the aberrant MBNL1 mega-complexes that develop in DM1 myoblasts. In complementary experiments the role of these complexes in dictating RNA splice site choice will be defined. The Aims of this application are: 1. Purification and functional characterization of normal MBNL1 complexes in spliceosome assembly and RNA catalysis. 2. Purification of MBNL1 mega-complexes from DM1 myoblasts and definition of the mechanics of mega-complex formation in vivo. 3. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which formation of MBNL1 mega-complexes alters the splice code in DM1 myoblasts.        ","479733",

Such a unified approach is essential in explaining how tissue movement finally results in the perception of speech sounds. Because of its role both as a coupled oscillator with the vocal folds and as the acoustic source the glottal airflow provides information about both vocal fold vibration and the resulting acoustic signal that listeners ultimately perceive as voice quality. While the field of aeroacoustics and the theory of vortex sound are relatively advanced the application of such theories to voice production is still in its infancy. Accordingly exploitation of such theories in a comprehensive systematic study of phonation over a broad range of phonatory conditions holds considerable promise for furthering our understanding of voice source mechanisms. Over a five-year period we propose to address the following Specific Aims using analytic/computational models of phonation and three laboratory models of phonation (a driven physical model a self-oscillating physical model and human excised larynges): (1) quantify the near field glottal airflow over the breathy to pressed voice continuum as manipulated by glottal adduction (2) quantify the near field glottal airflow as a function of voice type (chest falsetto vocal fry) as induced by changes in the body/cover parameters of the vocal folds (3) quantify the near field glottal airflow as a function of source/tract interactions (4) quantify the near field glottal airflow as a function of left-right asymmetries of the vocal folds. For each of these Specific Aims we will measure the near field glottal airflow identify the voice source mechanisms contained therein quantify the relative contribution of these voice source terms to the radiated acoustic output and perform a spatio-temporal decomposition of the near field glottal airflow to extract the primary orthogonal models of the airflow and reveal the interaction of these modes in this critical sound-producing region. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will not only improve our understanding of voice source mechanisms across a variety of normal and disordered voice types but also reveal relationships and interactions between various elements of the speech chain including vocal fold dynamics aerodynamics acoustics and perception. In the future this knowledge eventually may be conceptualized in the development of accurate efficient reduced-order models of phonation which may assist in practical clinical applications.      ","409020",

Although glial cells have been recently recognized as playing key roles in neuronal function sculpting synaptic connections and providing essential trophic factors to neurons there are major gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating their diverse actions. This proposal employs a highly tractable system the glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to investigate major questions in glial cell biology with exquisite cellular detail. Our preliminary data provides compelling evidence for a role of glial cells in the plasticity of NMJs regulating an important pathway required for the differentiation of synapses and sculpting synaptic connections by a process of pruning. In this project we will (Aim 1) test the hypothesis that glial cells play a primary role in the extension and retraction of synaptic boutons during NMJ expansion (Aim 2) test the hypothesis that glial cells regulate a Wnt pathway at the NMJ and that this regulation is essential for NMJ development and (Aim 3) determine the role of the Draper signaling pathway in sculpting synaptic connections at the NMJ. We expect that these studies will provide fundamental insights into the cellular interactions between synapses and glia in live animals and unravel molecular mechanisms by which glia actively sculpt synaptic connections. Project Narrative     Glial cells the major cell type in the human brain have emerged as important regulators of brain development and physiology and a number of devastating neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or glioma are associated with glial dysfunction.

Our work will provide fundamental knowledge regarding how neurons and glia communicate during the modification of synapses and is expected to provide important insights into how glial dysfunction might cause disease.      ","355469",

However the accuracy of direct radioimmunoassays for the measurement of total T levels has been questioned. Furthermore reference limits for total and free T levels generated in a population-based sample of community-dwelling men are not available. In the absence of standardized reference limits the partitioning of total and free T levels into normal or low values is fraught with substantial risk of misclassification. The objective of this collaboration among investigators from BUMC Framingham Heart Study (FHS) CDC and Mayo Clinic is to generate reference limits for total and free T levels in a sample of healthy young men in the community- based FHS third generation (Gen 3) cohort. Total T levels will be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a CDC calibrator. We will calculate free T from total T and SHBG by using law of mass action equation in accordance with Endocrine Society's position statement. We will generate reference limits for total and free T levels using nonparametric methods stratifying by age and apply the reference limits generated in Gen 3 sample to the distribution of values in a  broad sample  of men in both Gen 3 and Offspring (Gen 2) cohorts. We will evaluate the cross-sectional clinical correlates of total and free T levels in the broad sample using multivariable regression. adjusting for age BMI co-morbid conditions smoking and physical activity. Longitudinally we will relate total and free T levels at baseline (examination 7) to the incidence of adverse outcomes (primary: mortality diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease events (CVD); secondary: progression of functional limitations and disability) over a follow-up of 10 years. We will develop recommendations for partitioning of men into those with low or normal levels based on considerations of statistical distribution of total and free T values and the association of outcomes with varying degree of deviations from the reference limits. The proposed study will provide a framework for the interpretation of serum T levels and enhance the comprehensibility of circulating T values to practicing clinicians. These steps will facilitate the development of rational criteria for classifying men into androgen-deficient and androgen-replete categories.         ","412814",

Novel statistical analysis tools based on trajectories over time provide a more realistic and complete picture of treatment effects on drinking behavior and of the interplay of treatment compliance and treatment response. The COMBINE Study is the largest randomized clinical trial to date designed to answer questions about the benefits of combining behavioral and pharmacological interventions. It was successful in confirming some hypotheses but provided discouraging results on other primary efficacy hypotheses. Further understanding of both the positive and the negative results of this study identifying subgroups of subjects for whom treatment is effective and assessing the effects of compliance on response are vital to moving the field of alcohol research forward towards improved therapies and individual-based treatments. Herein we propose to assess patterns of change over time in drinking and compliance in the COMBINE Study using the trajectory-based approach of Nagin (1999). The study enrolled 1383 abstinent alcohol dependent patients and tested the efficacy of naltrexone acamprosate and Combined Behavioral Intervention (CBI). Analyses of the two primary endpoints time to the first day of heavy drinking and percent days abstinent revealed that either naltrexone or CBI improved outcomes compared to MM + placebo but surprisingly the combination of naltrexone + CBI did not yield better outcomes than either treatment alone and acamprosate was not efficacious either alone or in combination with naltrexone or CBI. The trajectorybased approach will allow characterization of the heterogeneity in participants' drinking behavior and treatment compliance will shed light on some of the negative findings regarding acamprosate and the combination of naltrexone and CBI and will allow assessment of the interplay between compliance treatment and drinking behavior. Our specific aims are 1) to identify different trajectory classes of drinking over time and to assess medication and CBI main effects and interactions on the probability to follow particular trajectories 2) to examine trajectories of drinking prior to randomization as potential moderators of naltrexone acamprosate and CBI effects 3) to examine trajectories of treatment participation (e.g. MM CBI and medication adherence) and their effects on treatment response and 4) to explore trajectories of drinking following discontinuation of treatment. The results of these analyses may offer new theoretical and clinical insights into the use of medications and behavioral interventions for the treatment of alcohol addiction.      ","190249",

Approximately 10-15% of very preterm children (born < 30 weeks gestational age) develop cerebral palsy and 30 - 60% of very preterm children experience cognitive impairments. These impairments include visual-motor problems attentional difficulties impaired memory delayed acquisition of language executive dysfunction learning disabilities poor social skills and higher rates of social withdrawal anxiety and depression. In addition an increased prevalence of developmental disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder autism and schizophrenia has been described in the preterm population. These adverse outcomes are related to white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) injury sustained during the neonatal period and its effects on subsequent brain development. We seek to develop imaging biomarkers measurable during infancy that provide sensitivity and specificity in identifying infants at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome. The biomarkers will consist of the following magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures: 1) conventional T1- and T2-weighted images 2) volumetry (volumes for cortical GM deep nuclear GM myelinated WM unmyelinated WM and cerebrospinal fluid) 3) diffusion tensor imaging (apparent diffusion coefficient relative anisotropy axial and radial diffusivity) and 4) surface-based morphometry (integrated folding index average sulcal depth cortical surface area percentage of buried cortex). The main cohort of this study will consist of 120 very preterm infants born < 30 weeks gestational age. They will undergo MR studies soon after birth at 30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) 34 weeks PMA and term equivalent. Infants enrolled during Year 1 (n = 30) will also be imaged at age 4 years. The MR indices listed above will be compared with MR data from healthy control subjects and clinical outcome data obtained at term equivalent and 2 and 4 years of age. The proposed studies are designed to engender a deeper understanding of the nature and timing of cerebral injury laying the groundwork for the development of neuroprotective strategies and improving clinical practices. The longitudinal design will allow us to study both structural abnormalities and compensatory changes in response to injury. Identification during the newborn period of infants at high risk for poor developmental outcome will allow early targeting of therapy services to these infants. If successful the proposed studies will lead to improved outcomes for prematurely-born infants.  Project Narrative:  This study is designed to use magnetic resonance imaging to improve our understanding of the brain injury sustained by prematurely-born infants. This understanding has the potential to improve clinical practices and assist with the development of medications to reduce injury in these babies ultimately reducing disabilities. It will also help identify those infants who are at high risk for developing cerebral palsy or mental retardation so they can be provided early access to therapy services.      ","566591",

In animal studies conducted by our group and others estrogen reduced activation and secretion of vasoconstrictor and mitogenic cytokines from platelets and reduced myointimal hyperplasia in response to arterial endothelial injury. However similar mechanisms of how estrogen affects platelet activity and their relationship to vascular anomalies have not been validated in humans. Proposed experiments fill several important gaps in knowledge identified in the 2007 Position Statement of the North American Menopause Society by providing the first mechanistic longitudinal analysis during menopausal aging of ways that MHT affects platelet activity in women in whom arterial anatomy is measured. The central hypothesis is that platelet activity is regulated in part by estrogen status (replete or deplete) and that increases in platelet procoagulant activity contribute to increased formation of lesions in the arterial wall. This hypothesis is based on the findings that thrombotic risk increases with age and that cardiovascular disease increases exponentially in women in the estrogen-deplete condition of menopause. Proposed experiments exploit a unique opportunity to evaluate healthy newly menopausal women (ages 42- 58 years) enrolled in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) a primary prevention study to determine whether treatment with either oral conjugated equine estrogen or transdermal 172-estradiol reduces carotid intimal medial thickness and coronary arterial calcification. This project is novel in several aspects: 1) it will provide the first mechanistic longitudinal study of menopausal aging and platelet procoagulant activity; 2) it will compare effects of oral vs. transdermal estrogen preparations on platelet procoagulant activity; 3) it will define genetic factors that determine individual responses to estrogen using a polygenomic approach; finally 4) it will relate changes in platelet procoagulant activity to vascular anomalies thus allowing our observations in experimental animals to be translated to humans. These approaches will provide new mechanistic insights into how estrogen affects progression of cardiovascular disease and have the potential to lead to development of novel diagnostic strategies to establish a benefit/risk profile for an individual woman contemplating use of MHT.This project will examine how aging and hormones used to treat menopausal symptoms change the ability of the blood to clot in women enrolled in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS). This project is unique because it focuses on cellular parts of the blood called platelets whereas previous hormone studies only examined proteins in the blood that cause clot formation. This study addresses three important  needs for research  identified by the North American Menopause Society: 1) it examines estrogen effects on hypercoagulability of the blood specifically platelets; 2) it compares different formulations of estrogen and 3) it uses a polygenomic approach to identify persons at risk for thrombosis induced by estrogen. Thus results will identify which women could benefit most with the least harm from hormone use in early menopause.      ","382978",

LTC4S is highly specific for its substrate leukotriene (LT) A4 which it conjugates with reduced glutathione to form LTC4 responsible for the characteristic symptoms of asthma including bronchoconstriction mucus hypersecretion and edema of the airways. To gain an understanding of the molecular mechanism and the consequences of the specificity for treatment as well as membrane protein structures in general we propose to study human LTC4S by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) specifically electron crystallography. Our Preliminary Studies show that human LTC4S can be overexpressed and purified to an extent and in a quantity which allows us to reproducibly induce two-dimensional (2D) crystallization. The resulting crystals are large and highly ordered and projection data extending to better than 4E resolution visualizes four transmembrane 1-helices. Based on previous site-directed mutagenesis studies we hypothesize that Arg-51 and Tyr-93 are involved in catalysis while Ile-27 Val-35 Val-49 Arg-51 Ala-52 Asn-55 Tyr-59 Tyr-93 Tyr-97 and Ala- 112 form the binding site for LTA4 and glutathione. Structural data would provide important information regarding the understanding of the arrangement and role of these residues and provide a basis for further functional studies by both biochemical and structural means. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will determine an atomic structure of human LTC4S by collecting and analyzing data of tilted and untilted 2D crystals by cryo-EM. The structure would allow us conclusions about the location and residues forming the active site. In Aim 2 we will crystallize various mutants of human LTC4S and carry out inhibition and activation studies to understand the detailed molecular mechanism and the high specificity of the enzyme. This information might eventually be used to explore LTC4S specific inhibitors.Project Narrative     The atomic model of human leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) and an insight into its reaction mechanism might lead to a better understanding and treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases including asthma allergic rhinitis and pulmonary fibrosis. In particular LTC4S specific inhibitors could be explored once the structure is available.      ","313875",
