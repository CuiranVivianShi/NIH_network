Overweight womenare at significantly increased risk of urinaryincontinence and over 65% of womenwith incontinence are overweight. Data from short-term preliminarystudies suggestthat weight reduction may significantly reduce incontinence episodes. Thus weightless may present a promising new approach to urinary incontinence treatmentone likely to produce a cascadeof broader health improvements in addition to reductions in frequencyof urinary incontinence. Therefore wepropose to randomize 330 overweight and obese womenwith urinary incontinence (165 at each of two clinical centers) to a 6-month intensive behavioral weight control programor to usual care to determine the short-term effect of weight loss on frequency of incontinence and quality of life to identify women most likely to benefit from weight loss and to beginto explore the urodynamicmechanisms underlying incontinenceimprovement following weight loss. To maximize enduring effects of weight loss on urinary incontinence it will be necessary to producesustained weight loss. However weight maintenance remainsa challenge in the obesity field. Thereforewe propose to evaluate an innovative theory-guided weight maintenance program that will focus on increasing motivation and commitment to behavior change efforts and comparethis with a more standard skills-focused weight maintenance program.After completing the 6-month weight loss programwomen in the weight loss arm will be randomizedto either a 12-month standard skill-based maintenance programor to a motivationally-focused maintenance intervention. Outcomes will include weight loss incontinence frequency and quality of life at 18 months. If effective in women with incontinence the methods and strategies of thisinnovative motivationally-focused maintenance intervention can be examined in other obesepopulations. WIN- Weight Reduction for Incontinence Network- brings together a unique group of outstanding and experienced investigators with expertise in urinary incontinence obesity treatment and multicenter collabora- tive clinical trials at three Institutions The proposed study design will allow us to efficiently evaluate both a novel treatment for urinary incontinence and a promising approach to enhancement of weight maintenance and therefore to make substantive contributions to severalclinical arenas critical to women's health.","224572",

In this ecological setting transmission of Schistosoma haematobium Plasmodium spp. filarial nematodes and geohelminths is common resulting in high levels of human urinary schistosomiasis malaria lymphatic filariasis and hookworm infection. These infections because of their combined long-term effects appear to play a significant but as yet incompletely defined synergistic role in the causation of chronic clinical and subclinical human disease and poverty. In this context transmission patterns and risk factors for these diverse parasitic infections often appear to be linked and to overlap extensively. However to date most studies have not approached the complexity of multi-parasite ecology because of limitations on data availability and accuracy and because of variable heterogeneities of infection risk that are found across physical and social space and over time. The project's underlying hypothesis is that environmental factors are the key determinants of transmission potential for these parasites and that these interact with demographic and socio-economic factors in determining the observed spatial/demographic patterns of parasitic disease. Recent research findings on parasite eco-epidemiology indicate that these effects all need to be reconsidered on multiple levels-individual household village and district-wide-separately for each parasite and for the combined suite of infections. Transmission processes and disease patterns vary across these multiple levels and will also vary spatially and temporally within each level. The combined impact of these endemic infections has not been well studied and may prove to have additive or more complex non-linear interactive effects. Consequently optimal control strategies may prove to require local reduction of both transmission (preventing infection) and disease manifestations through the integrated targeting of one some or all of these parasitic infections in concert. Specific Aims of this project are to detect spatial and demographic patterns of transmission and infection for schistosomiasis malaria filariasis and hookworms in coastal Kenya through integration of parasitological data with landscape land use and socioeconomic risk factors; to develop network- and individual-based models to identify the critical features of transmission and predict the potential impact of integrated control programs on distribution of malaria filaria schistosomes and hookworm and their related community disease impact; and strengthen training in infectious disease ecology for health problems in Africa.      ","488208",

With a specific focus on adult anorexia nervosa (AN) we propose to unite the expertise of a team skilled in the treatment of AN with world leaders in the development of couple-based interventions to develop an innovative intervention for couples in which one member is suffering from AN. The intervention ""UCAN: Uniting Couples (in the treatment of) Anorexia Nervosa"" acknowledges that AN occurs in an interpersonal context both being affected by the person's social environment and impacting important interpersonal relationships. Moreover the demonstrated success of family therapy for younger individuals with AN underscores the importance of leveraging family support in the treatment of AN. UCAN tailors cognitive-behavioral couple-based interventions that have been employed successfully for the treatment of depression anxiety disorders smoking cessation and cancer to address the core psychopathology of AN while also addressing the unique and challenging stresses that AN places on intimate relationships. Our initial conceptualization of the intervention focuses first on addressing AN within the context of the relationship with foci such as altering interactions around eating and weight normalizing activity and health behaviors body image physical affection and sexuality and second on addressing the broader relationship to maintain treatment gains prevent relapse and foster relationship satisfaction. The specific aims are: 1) to develop and standardize a manualized intervention for couples in which one member suffers from AN; 2) to determine feasibility and acceptability of a beta- version of UCAN in an open trial as an augmentation to treatment as usual (TAU) and to refine UCAN based on feedback from the preliminary trial; 3) to test UCAN+TAU versus TAU in a randomized controlled trial of 24 couples in which one member has AN; and 4) to adapt an observational couples assessment measure with the eventual goal of incorporating biological measures of affiliation and stress. Our primary patient outcomes will be BMI and global improvement and our secondary patient outcomes will be depression anxiety and relationship adjustment and communication. Partner outcomes will also include caregiving measures. This trial will be designed explicitly to gather preliminary outcome data to inform sample size and power calculations for a subsequent larger randomized controlled trial. Findings from this investigation have the potential to result in the creation of an effective acceptable developmentally tailored intervention that will improve both core AN pathology as well as couple functioning. Future extensions of the intervention will include couple-based interventions for eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. We propose to develop a couple-based intervention for adults with anorexia nervosa entitled ""UCAN: Uniting Couples (in the treatment of) Anorexia Nervosa."" We will create an effective acceptable developmentally tailored intervention that leverages the support of partners to improve both core anorexia nervosa pathology as well as couple functioning.      ","182500",

Deleterious alcohol-related health effects attributed to internal organ toxicity include irreversible brain tissue injury. Brain tissue of chronic alcoholics features neurodegeneration paralleling neuro-cognitive deficits. The causes of HIV-1-associated neurotoxicity clinically manifesting as HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD) include excitotoxic effects of glutamate secretory products of chronically activated glial cells and oxidative stress similar culprits to ones mediating alcohol-induced neuronal injury. Alcohol abuse and HIV-1 infection of central nervous system (CNS) could result in combined toxic effects leading to neuronal demise and cognitive dysfunction. The current grant application is focused on putative mechanisms of enhanced neurotoxicity in the setting of alcohol abuse and HIV-1 CNS infection. Specifically we will study unique aspects of astrocyte dysfunction caused by HIV-1 CNS infection and alcohol abuse. We hypothesize that astrocyte dysfunction caused by alcohol metabolites and oxidative stress results in (1) increased glutamate levels via down regulation of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT-2 the primary astrocyte glutamate scavenger) causing neuronal injury; (2) production of pro-inflammatory factors (via activation of Src kinases and phospholipase A2); and (3) enhanced activity of metalloproteases (MMPs) resulting in loss of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity. We mechanistically address the role of oxidative stress in astrocytes leading to production of pro-inflammatory molecules and impairment of glutamate uptake by astrocytes. Using a combination of in vitro systems an HIVE animal model chronically exposed to alcohol and in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy we will investigate the astrocyte dysfunction as a focal point of combined effects of HIV-1 and alcohol abuse in the CNS. We will address the following questions: (1) What are the underlying mechanisms causing astrocyte pro-inflammatory phenotype in the setting of alcohol abuse and HIV-1 CNS infection that cause activation of MMPs and BBB dysfunction? (Aim 1); (2) What is the role/contribution of enhanced production of reactive oxygen species Rho GTPases and NF-?B signaling in diminished expression and function of EAAT-2 in astrocytes? (Aim 2); (3) How effective are the therapeutics that target oxidative stress and EAAT-2 dysregulation in ameliorating neurotoxicity and BBB impairment in an animal model for HIV-1 encephalitis and alcohol abuse? (Aim 3). Antioxidants and specific signaling inhibitors will be utilized to delineate pathways involved in these effects. We believe that the proposed works are highly significant as they will uncover novel mechanisms involved in the combined effects of HIV-1 and alcohol abuse in the CNS and propose therapeutic approaches based on these investigations.     Public Health Relevance: Alcohol is abused by millions of Americans has long lasting toxic effects on the central nervous system. Clinical studies indicated that alcohol dependence has an additive effect on cognitive deficits associated with HIV-1 infection. Current proposal aims to understand mechanisms of combined effects of HIV-1 and alcohol abuse in the brain and to propose neuroprotective therapies.      ","330750",

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. Androgen action and the functional status of the AR are believed to be the important mediators of prostate cancer development. Although androgen/AR is known to promote growth of androgen-dependent prostate tumors its function in tumor metastasis is unclear at present. A preliminary study has been made in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mouse models of prostate cancer and discovered that ablation of the AR in prostate epithelium resulted in development of larger pelvic lymph node (PLN) metastatic tumors and higher numbers of liver metastatic foci suggesting that AR might function as a suppressor of prostate tumor metastasis. Therefore the proposed studies will use various ARKO models of TRAMP mice and human prostate cancer cell lines with different AR expression to investigate the suppressor role of AR in prostate tumor metastasis. Initially prostate epithelium-specific (pes) AR knockout (ARKO) (Aim 1) and inducible ARKO TRAMP mice (Aim 2) will be generated to study the effect of pes-ARKO and induction of ARKO after prostate tumors have developed on PLN metastatic tumor formation and growth as well as the expression levels of various metastasis-related genes. Subsequently the effect of suppressing AR expression (with AR-specific RNA interference) in AR-positive and restoring AR expression (with functional AR cDNA) in AR-negative PLN tumor cells and various human prostate cancer cell lines (Aim 3) on their invasive properties and expression levels of metastasis-related genes will be studied in vitro as well as in bone xenografts in SCID mice. Finally the molecular mechanisms through which AR regulates the expression levels of various metastasis-related genes will be studied (Aim 4). Therefore the success of this application undoubtedly will uncover an alterative role of the AR as a metastasis suppressor during prostate cancer progression. The establishment of the AR function as a metastasis suppressor and understanding of how it regulates tumor metastasis-related genes should lead to new concepts of treatment modality and molecular targeting for prostate cancer therapy.   Project Narrative: Loss of Androgen Receptor Promotes Metastatic Cancer. We will study the loss of androgen receptor in prostate epithelium and the influence of this loss on prostatic metastatic tumor invasion. The success of this application undoubtedly will uncover an alterative role of the androgen receptor as a metastasis suppressor during prostate cancer progression. The establishment of the androgen receptor function as a metastasis suppressor and understanding of how it regulates tumor metastasis-related genes should lead to new concepts of treatments and molecular targets for prostate cancer therapy.        ","292600",

The proposal is based on behavioral experiments where we show that microinfusion of both 1 and 2 adrenergic antagonists confined to the olfactory bulb interferes with the ability of mice to discriminate between structurally related odors. In addition we present patch clamp experiments in olfactory bulb slices that show both acute and long term effects of noradrenaline on mitral cell function that likely underlie the effect of the adrenergic antagonists in vivo. We hypothesize that noradrenaline modulates odor responsiveness and mitral cell action potential firing and that these changes in mitral cell function contribute to the behavioral discrimination of closely related odors. In order to test this hypothesis we will utilize the powerful techniques of assessment of olfactory ability through computer-assisted operant conditioning and adrenergic receptor pharmacology with patch clamp studies of modulation of mitral cell function in olfactory bulb slices.     Two aims are proposed. Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that centrifugal noradrenergic modulation of olfactory bulb function is necessary for discrimination of closely related odors.     Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that noradrenaline modulates cellular properties and mitral cell spike activity in mouse olfactory bulb slices. This interdisciplinary approach will allow us to critically assess the cellular and synaptic basis of modulation of olfactory behavior by noradrenergic modification of olfactory bulb function.7. Project Narrative. In humans disorders of the sense of smell are encountered in diseases such as Alzheimer's (Doty 1991;Rawson 2000) bipolar depression (Hahn et al. 2005) and schizophrenia (Turetsky et al. 2003). This grant will study noradrenergic modulation of olfactory bulb function. The study of noradrenergic modulation is relevant to schizophrenia (Yamamoto and Hornykiewicz 2004) whose etiology we study in the Restrepo laboratory.      ","364320",

Our sample is comprised of 627 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adolescents recruited during their junior year in high school. Using a high risk design we overselected (60%) Ps who scored high on a measure of neuroticism to increase our power to identify risk factors for emotional disorders and allow evaluation of various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress? We now propose to extend data collection for another 4 years by which time most of our sample will be aged 23 to 25 years. By so doing we will extend the goals of the parent grant in several ways. First we will be able to study risk factors for emotional disorders whose average age of onset peaks after the original window of 16   20 years. Second we will be better able to evaluate risk factors for course severity and comorbidity among the emotional disorders. Third by repeating risk measurement we will be able to evaluate stability/plasticity in risk and its relationship to the onset course and comorbidity of emotional disorders. In addition we propose several new directions. First we propose to evaluate the relationship between genetic markers (DRD4 5HTT and markers of coping) and emotional disorders especially the interaction between genetic markers and indices of episodic and chronic life stress and the hypothesized role of personality traits in mediating the associations between the genetic markers and emotional disorders. Also we propose to evaluate potential candidate genetic markers of coping styles that have been hypothesized to decrease risk for emotional disorders. Second we propose to evaluate personality pathology and its moderation of psychopathology over the period of transition into adulthood. We will also test whether attainment of developmental milestones associated with young adulthood and whether changes in normal personality traits common in young adulthood are predicted by earlier personality trait levels and emotional disorders and are predictors of later emotional disorders. Furthermore we propose additional risk variables of early adversity perceived control coping style and rumination.      ","333874",

As a case in point medical errors persist at a distressing rate and incur enormous costs despite extensive publicity and considerable research. Because healthcare is a complex sociotechnical system these medical errors generally have no simple single cause. Instead the errors typically are the result of system failures that involve many individuals many contributing factors and encompass multiple levels of the health care system. In our previous research we have shown that computational modeling using OrgAhead is a valuable research tool for dealing with these types of complex multi-level problems. Building on that work we propose using a network-based theory of organizations as complex adaptive systems to develop desktop decision support tools and methods that help managers (a) assess their unit's current performance and (b) predict the impact of potential unit innovations to improve targeted safety and quality outcomes. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop a simple virtual environment that allows nurse managers to assess through a dynamic network analysis decision support tool (DyNADS) the organizational health of their patient care units and then engage in strategic planning by using automated ""what-if"" analysis techniques to test on the virtual units the likelihood of potential innovations to improve their actual units' safety and quality outcomes. Specific aims are to:   1. Refine and streamline data collection requirements for DyNADS to fit within the unit management workflow.   2. Design a prototype desktop dynamic network analysis decision support tool (DyNADS) that facilitates: (a) identifying structures or communication patterns that are the basis for system failures in acute care settings and (b) testing the likelihood of potential innovations to improve safety and quality outcomes.   3. Evaluate DyNADS' validity scalability and usefulness through a field test.  4. Evaluate the feasibility of implementing DyNADS or nursing units.      ","419585",

Spliceosomal RNAs and proteins are critical for eukaryotic gene expression yet little is understood about their structure and function. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the structures of highly conserved RNA complexes and ribonucleoproteins from the spliceosome and understand how the structures change throughout the splicing cycle. Aim 1 is to investigate the structure and function of the U6 RNA-Prp24 ribonucleoprotein complex. Prp24 protein tightly binds to U6 RNA in the free U6 snRNP and is required for U6 RNA structural remodeling during spliceosome assembly and activation. We recently solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal two-thirds of Prp24 and defined a putative U6 RNA binding surface by NMR. The structure of U6 RNA will be determined alone and in complex with Prp24 using both NMR and X- ray studies. These data will reveal how Prp24 remodels the U6 RNA structure to facilitate pairing with U4 RNA during spliceosome assembly and with U2 RNA during spliceosome activation. In vitro biochemical and in vivo genetic studies will be used to further probe the mechanism by which Prp24 acts as a U6 RNA chaperone. Aim 2 of the proposal is to determine the structure of the U2-U6 RNA complex. The U2-U6 complex resides within the catalytic core of the spliceosome and directly hydrogen bonds to the pre-mRNA substrate in the active site. Furthermore the human U2-U6 complex has residual catalytic activity in the absence of proteins. For this aim we have identified a well-folded fragment of U2-U6 RNA that maintains tertiary structure and is amenable to NMR structure determination. As a sub-aim we will collaboratively develop new methods for refining large multi-domain RNA NMR structures against small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data and pseudo-CSA restraints. We expect these methods will be of general utility for structure determination of large macromolecules in solution. Prp24 binds to the U2-U6 RNA construct and we will attempt to determine the structure of this ribonucleoprotein complex which may mimic a true intermediate in spliceosome activation and/or disassembly. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the allosteric cascade that drives spliceosome assembly activation catalysis and disassembly.Narrative     The spliceosome is an intricate cellular machine composed of 5 RNAs and more than 75 proteins. The spliceosome is so vital to the cell that even a subtle defect in just one of its components results in the disease retinitis pigmentosa which causes blindness. Our work will result in a better understanding of the mechanism by which this remarkable molecular machine processes messenger RNA so that proteins can be made correctly by cells.      ","273585",

Two of these diseases targets of investigation by this grant application are stroke and metastatic cancer. Evidence has shown that members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases of which 26 are known play key roles in these processes. In particular there is clear indication that gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) are major contributors. Broad-spectrum synthetic MMP inhibitors were shown to be effective anti-cancer agents in animal models of cancer but produced serious side effects in clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. Broad inhibitory properties of these inhibitors against all MMPs and several related metalloproteinases have been postulated as one of the major reasons for the difficulties and the undesired side effects. We have answered this challenge and have devised the first mechanism-based (suicide) inhibitor (inhibitor 1) that is highly selective for gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) as evidenced by in vitro investigations with purified enzymes. Inhibitor 1 is also active in rodent models for two distinct cancers and stroke. Despite the early promise of inhibitor 1 the molecule is not poised to move forward as it is poorly water soluble and it is readily metabolized. The science disclosed herein is intended to devise the next generation of this type of inhibitor with attention to improved selectivity in targeting better aqueous solubility desirable pharmacokinetic properties and lead optimization which would move the project in the direction of preclinical development and subsequent entry into clinical trials. The clinical needs for intervention of stroke and of aggressive metastatic cancers are genuine. The science disclosed herein holds promise in meeting the clinical challenges.     When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis) it becomes a fatal disease. Similarly stroke is a big killer in the community. Spread of cancer and brain damage after stroke share a number of characteristics that are the subjects of this grant application. The grant applicants have developed a class of molecules that prevent cancer from spreading and prevent brain cell death due to stroke. The present grant application attempts to bring forward members of this type of drug forward for preclinical development.      ","372417",

Our laboratories have focused on the design and development of nanomaterials to achieve this purpose. For example the Reed laboratory has developed a semiconductor solid-state technology using CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor)-FET (field effect transistor) technology a critical step in system-scale integration of these sensors into standard electronics. These devices are amenable to chemical surface modification and are highly sensitive to bound molecular charge enabling rapid label-free detection (within seconds) of femtomolar concentrations of DNA and proteins in solution. In addition these new devices enable sensing of stimulus induced extracellular acidification of a minute number of cells in microliter volumes. The Fahmy laboratory is focused on the application of novel biomaterials to detection and modulation of the immune response. Here this combination of experience will be focused on the optimization and testing of these nanosensors as a diagnostic for detection of antigens antibodies and antigen-responsive lymphocytes. Our application aims to demonstrate the utility of this technology for cancer diagnostic applications. Our working hypothesis is that nanoscale CMOS wires can be developed as rapid quantitative diagnostic devices of soluble antigens as well as the immune response to those antigens. To test this hypothesis we propose to: 1) Fabricate integrated semiconducting nanosensors incorporating on-chip fluidics for high throughput sampling capability. 2) Optimize chemical surface modification of these sensors for ligand binding and test the limits of sensitivity of the sensor for detection of cancer markers and production of vaccine-mediated antibodies. 3) Demonstrate the utility of this system in the detection of antigen- specific lymphocyte responses and tumor-associated vaccine response. Because the strength of the approach lies in a novel fabrication scheme of nanowires and seamless integration with CMOS technology our approach facilitates wide use in basic and diagnostic clinical settings requiring sensitive and high-throughput screening of samples.     Relevance Statement: We have developed a novel technology to synthesizing nanowires (NWs) allowing their direct integration with microelectronic systems for the first time as well as their ability to act as highly sensitive biomolecule detectors that could revolutionize biological diagnostic applications. Our proposed work outlines a research plan for the development of the next generation portable electronic nanosensor and demonstrates its application in the read-out of cancer biomarkers and the immune response. These nanosensors can replace current technology with a powerful solid-state device useful for rapid diagnosis in clinical settings.      ","371438",

However methods of treatment are variable and re-injury rates tend to be high which in part reflects a lack of fundamental understanding of the factors that influence injury risk. The prevailing theory is that injury occurs as a result of excessive strain of active muscle fibers. The goal of this study is to develop novel biocomputational tools to predict and analyze the strain distributions within skeletal muscles during movements associated with injury. Model predictions will be compared with strain measures obtained using state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging experiments. Once validated we will use the biocomputational tools to investigate how morphology and coordination influence hamstring injury risk during running. Following are the specific aims. Aim 1 will use a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging technique to measure the strain distributions within the individual hamstring muscles during lengthening contractions a loading condition commonly associated with injury. Comparisons between muscles will provide new insights into the propensity for hamstring injury to occur in the biceps femoris long head. Aim 2 will build a biocomputational framework to predict muscle strain distributions during movement. The framework will couple finite-element simulations of muscle tissue behavior with dynamic simulations of whole body movement. The methods will be validated by comparing strain predictions with those determined from the dynamic images in Aim 1. We will then use the framework to investigate the relationship between muscle excitations hamstring tissue strains and skeletal movement during running. Aim 3 will evaluate whether computational models predict re-injury prevention strategies. We will build and validate models of subjects who exhibit residual changes in tissue structures as a result of a previous hamstring injury. We will then use the software framework to identify how movement coordination can be adapted to accommodate injury-induced changes in morphology. This research will establish a biocomputational framework that reveals the complex relationship between muscle morphology coordination and injury risk thus providing a new paradigm for identifying rehabilitation and injury prevention strategies. Muscle strain injuries are one of the most common conditions seen in sports medicine clinics. However methods of treating muscle injuries are variable and re-injury rates tend to be high. This proposal couples novel biocomputational tools and imaging techniques to establish a scientific basis for preventing and rehabilitating hamstring muscle injuries.      ","299757",

In most cases cancer cells initially spread through regional lymph nodes. Therefore clinical evaluation for the presence of regional lymph node metastases is of paramount importance. Unfortunately there are no real-time non-invasive clinical methods that can reliably detect and diagnose micrometastases in lymph node. Therefore there is an urgent clinical need for an imaging technique that is widely available is non-invasive and simple to perform is safe and can reliably detect and adequately diagnose lymph node micrometastases in real time. The overall goal of our research program is to develop an advanced in-vivo noninvasive molecular specific imaging technology i.e. integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging combined with targeted plasmonic nanosensors capable of immediate and accurate assessment of sentinel lymph node micrometastases in real time. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that photoacoustic imaging integrated with widely used clinical ultrasound imaging is possible and both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging can be performed in real time yielding an immediate diagnosis and allowing early implementation of treatment. A wide range of scientific and engineering biomedical and clinical problems must be addressed to fully explore the capabilities of molecular specific ultrasound and photoacoustic lymphatic (MS-USPAL) imaging in detection and characterization of sentinel lymph node micrometastases. The central theme of the current application is threefold: to design and build a laboratory prototype of the integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system to develop lymphatic contrast agent based on gold bioconjugated plasmonic nanosensors and to initially test the develop imaging technology in 3D tissue phantoms small animal model and finally excised cancerous tissue samples. Therefore all theoretical and experimental studies will be conducted to evaluate applicability of the developed MS-USPAL imaging system for sentinel lymph node micrometastases. At the end of the study we will outline the design and technical specifications of a clinical MS-USPAL imaging system.      ","340678",

During the first six months of solo driving the crash rate for newly-licensed teen drivers decreases by a factor of five (McCartt Shabanova and Leaf 2003). The only drivers at greater risk of crashing are those eighty years old and older. Perhaps not surprisingly automobile crashes are the leading cause of death for newly-licensed drivers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2004). The problem is an ongoing national tragedy that has continued for far too long. Standard driver education programs which typically involve 30 hours of classroom instruction and ten hours in the vehicle (four hours of observation and six hours behind the wheel) have until recently been the primary way teens learned to drive. Unfortunately evaluations undertaken over the last forty years have shown little effect of such programs on crash rates (Mayhew and Simpson 2002). Graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs are one response to the problem. The GDL programs clearly reduce crash rates among 16 year olds. However newly-licensed drivers obeying the law-alone and during the day-are still over-involved in crashes sometimes being as much as eight times more likely to be in a crash than are older drivers (Langone 2006). There are many reasons that standard driver education programs and GDL programs may not reduce crashes as much as might be expected among drivers obeying the law during the first six months of restricted licensure. Perhaps most obvious is that these efforts do not directly remediate three behaviors that have been hypothesized to be the primary causes of crashes among novice drivers: failures to (a) anticipate hazards (b) maintain attention and (c) control speed appropriately. Unfortunately little is known about whether these differences do indeed exist and if so the exact reasons newly-licensed and experienced drivers may differ from one another in each of these three areas. Until such is known one cannot design training programs that remediate the deficiencies. We are proposing a four year program of theoretical and applied research to address these problems. Phase 1: In the first year we will assess the hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control skills of newly-licensed drivers (teens who have had their restricted license six months or less) on a driving simulator and compare their performance with experienced older (40-55) drivers. Eye movements head movements driver behaviors (e.g. foot on or off the accelerator brake etc.) and vehicle behaviors (e.g. velocity brake pressure) will be monitored. We will determine the extent to which the differences in hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control are due to differences in the knowledge basic vehicle handling skills and task management routines of the two groups of drivers. Phase 2: In the second year we will develop and evaluate on a driving simulator a PC-based training program designed to improve hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control skills of newly-licensed drivers. The evaluations will take place immediately one month and three months after licensure. Phase 3: In the third year we will repeat our evaluation of the PC-based training program only this time evaluating newly-licensed drivers' hazard anticipation attention maintenance and speed control skills on the open road immediately one month and three months after training. Again eye movements head movements and driver and vehicle behaviors will be monitored.

Researchers have identified and engineered a variety of GFP-related proteins including red FPs such as DsRed but many of these new FPs give weaker fluorescence signals than GFP. Moreover monomeric FPs often show a residual self- association that results in mislocalization and even toxicity of fluorescent fusion proteins. Until these problems are remedied the new FPs will never be as broadly useful as GFP. The improvement of FPs will be aided by investigating the mechanisms of chromophore formation.     Our goal is to devise robust directed evolution strategies for enhancing the brightness and minimizing the self-association of DsRed and other FPs. In parallel structure-function analysis of wild-type and mutant FPs will help us to understand key properties such as the pathway of chromophore maturation.     This project is a collaboration between two groups with complementary expertise. One PI (Glick) has extensively engineered DsRed and has created rapidly maturing tetrameric and monomeric variants known commercially as ""DsRed-Express"" and ""DsRed-Monomer"" respectively. The other PI (Keenan) is a skilled structural biologist and an expert at improving proteins by directed evolution. This proposal has three Specific Aims.     Specific Aim #1: To develop assays and procedures for generating brighter FPs that are less prone to self-association. We will use homology- and structure-guided mutagenesis to enhance the fluorescence signals from monomeric FPs and to reduce the tendency of monomeric FPs to self-associate in vivo when present at high local protein concentrations.     Specific Aim #2: To devise a systematic assay system for testing whether a monomeric FP is a suitable fusion tag. We will fuse a monomeric FP to a set of 96 potentially aggregation- sensitive partner proteins in yeast. The resulting in vivo fluorescence patterns will be subjected to detailed image analysis.     Specific Aim #3: To characterize the chromophore maturation pathway and other properties of DsRed. The reactions that generate the DsRed chromophore are incompletely understood. We will test a novel maturation scheme that can explain previously puzzling results.    Fluorescent proteins have become key experimental tools for basic and applied biomedical research. The studies described here will expand the applications of this technology.      ","234572",

The hypothesis describes the sequence of steps whereby use of one class of drug e.g. cigarettes (nicotine) precedes the use of other drugs such as cocaine. We propose to test the Gateway Hypothesis at the molecular level using a mouse model. Our approach is further based on the evidence that addiction shares molecular steps and molecular logic with long-term memory. We will address four specific aims: (1) To determine on a behavioral and transcriptional level whether there is the sequential order between nicotine and cocaine predicted by the Gateway Hypothesis whether this sequence is unidirectional (from nicotine to cocaine) or bidirectional (from cocaine to nicotine) and whether nicotine can also enhance the response to drugs of abuse other that cocaine such as morphine. (2) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which nicotine primes an animal to the effects of cocaine we propose to use gene-chip analysis to selected target regions to survey patterns of mRNA in the striatum particularly the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala. We will use pharmacological analysis to dissect any possible signal transduction pathway that may mediate the priming effects and genetically modified mice to explore some of the selected candidate genes emerging from the screen. (3) To identify molecular mechanisms that might contribute to maintaining the gateway effect we will examine persistent histone acetylation focusing on promoters of FosB and c-Fos using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. (4) To characterize the nature and consequences of adolescent drug exposure in both behavioral and molecular terms we will replicate selected experiments outlined in Aims 1-3 (a) on adolescent mice to compare these results to those obtained on adults and (b) on adult mice preexposed to nicotine or cocaine to identify the consequences of adolescent drug exposure for drug responses in adulthood to the same or different drugs. Preliminary results from pilot studies support the proposed approach. In addition to testing certain fundamental hypotheses for understanding addiction these molecular insights are potentially useful for two reasons: (1) They may provide new molecular targets for the treatment of addiction; (2) They are likely to provide new hypotheses about drug behavior in human populations that can be further explored in epidemiological data. Drug abuse represents one of the most important public health issues in the nation. Drug abuse begins in adolescence with the use of one of the legal drugs alcohol or tobacco (nicotine); those who use one of these drugs are at much greater risk of progressing to the use of illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine. Those who start smoking in adolescence are much more likely to continue smoking as adults and to experience the adverse health consequences of smoking than individuals who start smoking later in life. The proposed research aims to elucidate the biological mechanisms that underlie the progression in drug use from nicotine to cocaine by using a mouse model. The findings of the research may make it possible to develop new drugs to prevent and treat substance abuse.       ","524169",

The dominant cause is acute rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques but no test is currently available to non-invasively identify vulnerable plaques during the asymptomatic stage. The quantum leap needed to address this profound health issue and the goal of this proposal is to develop a non-invasive technique that detects vulnerable plaques prior to rupture. Extravasation of erythrocytes and intra-plaque hemorrhage are considered critical factors in the transition of a plaque from the stable to unstable state. As a consequence iron a main component of red blood cells accumulates in the artery wall and its presence indicates impending rupture. A major challenge in using iron as an imaging marker of vulnerable plaque is the concurrent presence of calcium. Unlike iron coronary calcifications represent overall plaque burden rather than vulnerability. The great problem resulting from the co-localization of iron and calcium in individual plaques is that they are indistinguishable on both magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray computed tomography (CT) the two most accepted modalities for non-invasive imaging of coronary arteries. To solve this problem we have recently applied dual-energy CT which subtracts images acquired with substantially different energy spectra to discriminate materials that appear similar on conventional CT such as iron and calcium.     Based on our successful preliminary work our central hypothesis is therefore that dual-energy CT can directly detect vulnerable plaques in vivo by virtue of iron accumulation in the artery wall. Our objective during Phase I of this Quantum Program is to detect iron as a marker of vulnerable plaques despite the presence of calcium. The specific aims are (1): To develop an imaging technique that can detect iron and discriminate iron from calcium. Our working hypothesis is that CT images simultaneously acquired using a new dual-source CT system at two different x-ray tube potentials can be combined to unequivocally differentiate iron from calcium. We will use mixtures of iron and calcium solutions and sub-mm particles as well as explanted specimens of diseased vessels. Aim (2) is designed to measure intramural iron in vulnerable plaques of arterial specimens and in vivo. a) Using high resolution dual-energy microscopic CT (micro-CT) we will quantify the prevalence concentration and distribution of iron deposits in vulnerable plaques. b) Finally we will validate our dual-energy techniques in vivo using a diabetic pig model that develops unstable atherosclerotic lesions similar to patients. Histological techniques will be used to classify plaque stages.     In Phase II we will build a new generation of CT technology with the performance characteristics necessary to accurately detect hemorrhagic plaque in humans. The significance of this proposal is that by detecting and treating pre-symptomatic vulnerable plaques before they rupture the premature death loss of productivity hospitalization and treatment cost to society can be markedly reduced.      ","632947",

In the body soft connective tissues must withstand the physical forces that are created by physiological processes and by movement in every day life. Collagenous extracellular matrix provides tensile load bearing properties in all soft connective tissues. In some connective tissues such as skin and blood vessel extracellular elastin also contributes recoil in response to tensile strain. If we are to engineer functional connective tissues ""from scratch"" then it is crucial to understand the deposition and remodeling of extracellular matrix proteins particularly collagen and elastin. Only by fundamentally understanding the processes that govern matrix formation in regenerative medicine can we successfully design functional connective tissues. While multiple investigators have successfully engineered individual tissues with good mechanical properties we currently possess no tools for a more global understanding of the process of matrix formation. Mathematical models for matrix synthesis and mechanics and bioreactor systems that allow imaging of matrix deposition are not readily at hand. Indeed the focus of the NIH PAR 06-504 ""Enabling Technologies for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine"" is on the development of just such tools. In this application we will exploit and develop novel mathematical models bioreactors and non- invasive imaging systems to predict track and quantify the deposition of extracellular matrix in vitro. The goal of this work is to generate novel yet translatable tools for understanding extracellular matrix formation. These tools in turn will fundamentally advance our abilities to grow connective tissues for regenerative medicine. The imaging bioreactor and modeling approaches developed in this application will be directly translatable to other laboratories that are working in these areas. In order to ensure broad applicability of the tools created herein we will use mathematical models novel bioreactors and imaging systems to study matrix deposition in two commonly used tissue engineering systems: planar hydrogel scaffolds and tubular mesh scaffolds. Planar hydrogel scaffolds will be used as a model of sheet-like connective tissues such as fascia and ligament. Tubular mesh scaffolds will be used as a model of tubular connective tissues such as blood vessels. In both of these experimental systems we will apply novel bioreactors and non-invasive microscopy techniques and will couple experimental design and observations with computational models of extracellular matrix formation in order to advance our understanding of the deposition and remodeling of matrix proteins. The purpose of these studies is to develop broad generalizable tools for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. While methods for growing tissues have advanced our abilities to predict how tissues will develop and our abilities to monitor tissue growth remain very limited.

Ultrasound therapy is currently used clinically to promote bone healing and has been shown to enhance soft tissue repair. Some biological effects of ultrasound are known to result from the mechanical forces associated with acoustic wave propagation. In vitro studies demonstrate that mechanical stresses positively affect both extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cell behavior. Thus we hypothesize that acoustically-driven mechanical forces can be used to control ECM deposition and promote cell and tissue function. In this proposal we combine our knowledge of ECM biology and biomedical ultrasound to develop ultrasound-based enabling technologies for the fabrication and monitoring of functional 3D ECM and tissue analogs. To accomplish this goal we have developed four specific aims. In Aim 1 we will use ultrasound fields to fabricate ECM FN and collagen analogs and optimize ultrasound exposure conditions that enhance ECM-mediated fibroblast and epithelial cell growth. In Aim 2 we will develop the use of acoustically-driven mechanical forces to promote fibroblast migration into 3D collagen- based tissue constructs. In Aim 3 we will use acoustic fields to stimulate ECM organization in order to engineer the biological and material properties of collagen-based tissue constructs. In Aim 4 we will apply and extend our experience in ultrasound tissue characterization technologies to non-destructively quantify mechanical and biological properties of engineered tissues in real-time. We envision immense potential for the use of ultrasound technologies to provide break-through technologies for tissue fabrication and monitoring. Furthermore the ability of ultrasound to propagate through tissue as a focused beam has the potential to provide a revolutionary approach to locally regulate and monitor tissue regeneration deep within the body. Tissue engineering is a potentially revolutionary approach for replacing or regenerating diseased or destroyed organs and tissues. The current lack of available tissue analogs reflects an inability to create 3-D scaffolds that have both biological activity and adequate mechanical strength. We will develop ultrasound- based enabling technologies with the dual capacity to (i) create biologically-active 3-D tissue constructs for tissue engineering and (ii) non-invasively monitor the biological and mechanical properties of these constructs.

It has been reported that the DMA target recognition in vivo sometimes differs from the in vitro-based models.  Understanding the mechanisms that govern the specific DMA recognition in a cellular environment will profoundly augment our understanding of the mechanisms of transcription factor function and will also have a major impact in biomedical research. Furthermore it becomes apparent that new motif finding algorithms need to be developed that specifically for high-throughput protein-DNA in vivo interaction data.    The immediate goal of the proposed work is to develop the methodologies and tools to efficiently analyze high-throughput in vivo protein-DNA association data (like ChIP on chip) and identify the biologically important cis-regulatory elements. The more distant goal is to understand the rules that govern the interactions of transcription factors with their genomic DMA targets. The proposed activity aims initially to develop such a new motif finding software by expanding and testing various methods and strategies. Tests will be based on artificial and ""real"" data and the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods will be assessed. The best performing methods will be used to analyze existing and new ChIP on chip data and predict the cis-regulatory motifs which they will be subsequently confirmed with biochemical methods. Example transcription factors will be used to study the effect of particular cis-regulatory modules on gene expression with a goal of developing the methodology that will allow for complete computational models of gene regulation to be built. Finally a database and web-interface will be developed on and around the tools and the data we will produce that ill allow for efficient data dissemination analysis and mining.    To accomplish these goals a combination of biochemical experimentation and computational algorithmic development is needed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments will be coupled with promoter microarray hybridization (ChlP-on-chip) to identify possible targets for TGFbetal-induced transcription factors in primary lung cells. The data will be analyzed statistically to infer the appropriate quantitative models of the transcription factor binding. Publicly available and newly generated gene expression data will also be analyzed statistically to assess the effect of certain cis-regulatory modules in the expression of the downstream genes.      ","450324",

The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine the extent to which maternal propensity to obesity or actual obesity predisposes offspring to disorders of glucose regulation and weight homeostasis in this species. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1. To establish and characterize four study populations of pregnant females that a. are made obese prior to pregnancy through exposures to a proven obesity-inducing high-fat diet; b. have a propensity to DIO but are maintained on the typical low fat diet during pregnancy; c. are spontaneously obese; or d. remain lean while exposed to a high fat diet. These four populations will be characterized relative to glucose metabolism and regulation including baseline insulin and HbA1C glucose and response to an oral glucose tolerance test; food intake and physiological and behavioral responses to food; and body composition and circulating concentrations of leptin. 2. To characterize these study populations relative to the following variables during pregnancy and at birth: maternal glucose metabolism and regulation; maternal body composition and circulating concentrations of CRH leptin and estradiol; placental and fetal growth and development including placental function assessed through stereology and estimates of placental CRH leptin and IGF production; endocrine markers of placental size and function; and infant birth weight and and circulating insulin concentration. 3. To characterize changes in body composition feeding and metabolism from post-weaning infancy (6 months) to adulthood (24 months of age) in offspring of these pregnancies by: tracking growth trajectories while fed control or obesity-inducing diets; tracking development of feeding behaviors in weanling infants; determining response to food cues in adults; and tracking glucose metabolism and regulation. The primary null predictions are that obese females regardless of the source of obesity will display a ""pre-diabetic/mild diabetic"" profile resulting in fetal macrosomia and hyperinsulinemia that the DIO propensity group may differ from the diet resistant lean group in terms of metabolic parameters; and that adult offspring will mirror their dam in terms of body composition feeding behavior and glucose metabolism.      ","244862",

The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET mediate the protective effects of stearic acid on gestational diabetes and on the acquired diabetes of the progeny. Rationale. The goal of this proposal is to test the novel hypothesis that stearic acid ameliorates gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and subsequent diabetes in the progeny of GDM mothers through a triad of CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET proteins. We will use the CSTBLKS/J-Lep/*'* mouse that develops GDM around day 16 of gestation. We will examine the mechanisms of stearic acid on CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET expression and function in both GDM and on long-term metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in the progeny of the db/+ dams. Finally we will use individual genetic knockout models for each protein to determine the extent to which each protein mediates the action of stearic acid in both GDM and diabetes of the progeny. The uniqueness and potential clinical relevance of this approach is the mechanistic analysis of a possible means for treatment of both GDM and pursuant diabetes mellitus acquired by the offspring. We propose in vivo studies that can be further dissected by in vitro studies with isolated tissues and cells which will enable us to thoroughly explore the protective mechanism of action of stearic acid. 1. To determine the impact of stearic acid on the development and extent of GDM. Db/+ dams will be used to examine whether stearic acid affects the development of GDM by measuring oral glucose tolerance vascular responsiveness and adipocyte function. The expression and subcellular localization of CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET in adipose will be quantified and functionality of the proteins assessed through measurements of fatty acid biochemistry (p-oxidation fatty acid composition and angiotensin II secretion). Similarly we will also examine the effect of stearic acid treatment fed exclusively to the db/+ dams on the extent of diabetes in the offspring. Finally we will thoroughly examine the mechanism of action of stearic acid on fatty acid biochemistry in insulin resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This aim is important because we will mechanistically evaluate a potential palliative intervention for both GDM and the accompanying diabetes of the offspring. 2. To determine the duration which stearic acid improves the diabetic phenotype in db/db mice. Db/db progeny will be treated with stearic acid and the duration and extent of the protective effect investigated. The effect of withdrawal of stearic acid on the lasting benefit of the intervention will also be examined. We will measure blood pressure vascular responsiveness weight and glucose. We will examine the mechanisms of stearic acid action by determining the expression and subcellular location of CD36 ABCD2 and mitoNEET in adipose and assessing function of each protein through measurements of adipose fatty acid biochemistry. This aim is important because it will provide data on the cardiovascular benefit and sustainability of stearic acid intervention. 3. To determine whether the beneficial effects of stearic acid are mediated by CD36 ABCD2 and/or mitoNEET. We will cross mice null for CD36 ABCD2 or mitoNEET with db/+ mice and assess the efficacious effects of stearic acid in ameliorating GDM and the ensuing diabetic phenotype of the double crossed db/db progeny lacking each individual gene. We will measure OGTT vascular responsiveness and adipose fatty acid biochemistry in db/+ dams. Furthermore we will assess the effect of individual gene knockout on the ability of stearic acid to affect the development of diabetes in the db/db mice. This will be accomplished through measurements of weight glucose insulin blood pressure and vascular responsiveness. Mechanistically the effects of gene ablation will be dissected through comprehensive analyses of isolated primary adipose biochemistry. This aim is critical because each double crossed mouse line will provide the definitive mechanistic data regarding the role of each protein in mediating the beneficial effects of stearic acid.       ","291616",

In the LGN further segregations of anatomically and physiologically distinct visual pathways have been identified and extensively characterized. Likewise studies in a variety of species have noted the existence of multiple pathways from the SC to the thalamus although these pathways are largely uncharacterized and their functions remain unknown. The tree shrew with its expanded tectopulvinar system is an ideal species to begin to understand how pathways from the SC influence cortical activity via their projections to the pulvinar nucleus. Previous studies characterized two distinct zones in the tree shrew pulvinar nucleus a dorsal region (Pd) which receives diffuse convergent input from the SC and projects to the posterior temporal cortex (Tp) and a central region (Pc) which receives specific topographic projections from the SC and projects to the dorsal temporal cortex (Td). We propose to test the idea that separate tectopulvino- cortical pathways are organized to code distinct features of visual movement. To examine this hypothesis we will 1) use in vivo extracellular recordings to compare the activity of Pd and Pc neurons during the presentation a variety of computer generated stimuli designed to test responses to simple and complex visual motion 2) use in vitro whole cell recordings to compare the membrane properties of Pc and Pc neurons and their responses to stimulation of the SC 3) use tract tracing immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy to anatomically characterize the connections between the Pd and Pc and temporal cortex and 4) use in vivo intrinsic optical imaging to examine temporal cortex response pattern changes following deactivation of the SC Pd or Pc. Given the similarities between the tree shrew and primate visual pathways the results should further our understanding of human motion processing particularly within the tectopulvinar pathway and cortical area MT. Therefore the proposed studies should provide information relevant to the treatment of disorders of motion processing such as dyslexia schizophrenia autism and Williams Syndrome. The proposed studies may also provide insight into ""blindsight"" the ability of some patients to detect visual motion in the absence of visual perception.       ","306084",
